# Purpose

The AI Coding Standards define the requirements for AI-generated source code within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) platform.

These standards ensure that all AI-generated code is maintainable, secure, readable, testable, and consistent with the project's software architecture and development practices.

The standards apply regardless of the AI platform used to generate code.

---

# Objectives

AI-generated code should:

- Follow established project architecture.
- Be readable and maintainable.
- Minimize technical debt.
- Support scalability.
- Follow security best practices.
- Encourage code reuse.
- Be fully testable.
- Comply with project coding conventions.

---

# Coding Principles

## Readability

Generated code shall prioritize readability over brevity.

Code should:

- Use meaningful names.
- Follow consistent formatting.
- Minimize nesting.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Be easy for another developer to understand.

Readable code is preferred over clever code.

---

## Maintainability

AI-generated implementations should be easy to maintain.

Requirements include:

- Modular design
- Low coupling
- High cohesion
- Small reusable functions
- Clear separation of concerns

Future developers should be able to modify code with minimal effort.

---

## Consistency

Generated code shall follow the project's established conventions.

Consistency includes:

- Naming conventions
- Folder structure
- Component organization
- Error handling
- Logging
- Documentation
- Testing

Generated code shall never introduce conflicting styles.

---

## Simplicity

AI should generate the simplest implementation that satisfies the requirements.

Avoid:

- Premature optimization
- Unnecessary abstractions
- Duplicate logic
- Deep inheritance
- Overengineering

Simple implementations are easier to understand and maintain.

---

# Architecture Compliance

Generated code shall comply with the approved project architecture.

Examples include:

Frontend

- Angular Standalone Components
- Angular Material
- Reactive Forms
- Feature-based folder structure

Mobile

- Flutter
- Clean Architecture
- Repository Pattern
- Provider, Riverpod, or approved state management

Backend

- RESTful APIs
- Layered architecture
- Dependency injection
- Service-oriented design

Architecture shall never be bypassed for convenience.

---

# Naming Conventions

Generated identifiers shall be descriptive.

Examples

Variables

```
businessName
applicationStatus
paymentReference
```

Functions

```
submitApplication()
validatePermit()
calculateFees()
```

Components

```
BusinessRegistrationComponent
PermitDetailsComponent
DashboardCardComponent
```

Classes, files, and folders shall follow project naming conventions.

---

# Functions

Functions should:

- Perform one responsibility.
- Have descriptive names.
- Be concise.
- Avoid side effects where possible.
- Return predictable results.

Large functions should be decomposed into smaller reusable units.

---

# Error Handling

Generated code shall provide meaningful error handling.

Requirements:

- Handle expected failures.
- Avoid exposing internal details.
- Provide user-friendly messages.
- Log technical information appropriately.
- Preserve application stability.

Silent failures should be avoided.

---

# Input Validation

Every external input shall be validated.

Examples include:

- Form inputs
- API requests
- File uploads
- URL parameters
- Query strings

Validation should occur as early as practical.

---

# Security

AI-generated code shall follow secure coding practices.

Requirements include:

- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Parameterized database queries
- Secure authentication
- Authorization checks
- Secure file handling
- Secret management

Generated code shall never include:

- Hardcoded credentials
- API keys
- Passwords
- Tokens
- Sensitive configuration values

---

# Performance

Generated code should:

- Avoid unnecessary processing.
- Minimize network requests.
- Optimize rendering.
- Reuse resources efficiently.
- Prevent memory leaks.
- Scale appropriately.

Performance improvements should not reduce readability.

---

# Documentation

Complex logic shall include concise documentation.

Documentation should explain:

- Business purpose
- Non-obvious behavior
- Important assumptions
- External dependencies

Comments should explain why, not what.

Self-explanatory code should not require excessive comments.

---

# Logging

Generated code should implement structured logging where appropriate.

Logs should include:

- Errors
- Warnings
- Significant business events

Logs shall never expose:

- Passwords
- Authentication tokens
- Personal information
- Sensitive government records

---

# Dependency Management

AI-generated code should:

- Reuse approved libraries.
- Minimize unnecessary dependencies.
- Avoid deprecated packages.
- Follow organizational technology standards.

New dependencies require technical review.

---

# Testing Requirements

Generated code shall be testable.

AI should support:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Component testing
- API testing
- Error handling scenarios

Business logic should remain independent from presentation layers where possible.

---

# Code Quality

Generated code should satisfy:

- No duplicate logic
- Consistent formatting
- Low complexity
- Predictable behavior
- Proper encapsulation
- Appropriate abstraction

Quality shall take priority over rapid generation.

---

# Code Review

All AI-generated code shall undergo peer review.

Reviews should verify:

- Correctness
- Security
- Accessibility
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Compliance with project standards

AI-generated code shall never be merged without human approval.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

AI Coding Standards support:

- AI Development Principles
- Prompt Engineering Standards
- AI Architecture Guidelines
- AI Testing Guidelines
- AI Security Guidelines
- Design System
- Web Guidelines
- Mobile Guidelines

---

# Governance

All AI-generated source code within the eBPCO platform shall comply with these standards.

The Development Team and System Architect are responsible for reviewing, maintaining, and approving updates to this document as technologies and development practices evolve.
