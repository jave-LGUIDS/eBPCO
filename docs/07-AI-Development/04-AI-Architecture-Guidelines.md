# Purpose

The AI Architecture Guidelines establish the architectural requirements that Artificial Intelligence (AI) must follow when generating software solutions for the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) platform.

AI-generated architectures shall be scalable, maintainable, secure, testable, and aligned with enterprise software engineering principles. These guidelines ensure that AI-generated designs integrate seamlessly with the existing project architecture and support long-term sustainability.

These standards apply to all AI-assisted architectural recommendations, code generation, refactoring, and system design activities.

---

# Objectives

AI-generated architectures should:

- Follow approved enterprise architecture.
- Promote modular development.
- Encourage scalability.
- Support maintainability.
- Enable independent testing.
- Strengthen security.
- Reduce technical debt.
- Facilitate future system enhancements.

---

# Architectural Principles

## Separation of Concerns

AI shall organize software into distinct responsibilities.

Examples include:

- Presentation Layer
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Access Layer
- Infrastructure Layer

Each layer shall perform a single, well-defined responsibility.

---

## Modularity

Generated systems should be composed of independent modules.

Modules should:

- Be reusable.
- Be loosely coupled.
- Have well-defined interfaces.
- Minimize dependencies.

Changes within one module should not unnecessarily affect others.

---

## Scalability

Architectures shall support future expansion.

AI-generated designs should:

- Support additional modules.
- Handle increasing transaction volumes.
- Accommodate new government services.
- Allow integration with external systems.

Scalability shall be considered during initial design rather than added later.

---

## Maintainability

Architecture should simplify long-term maintenance.

AI should recommend:

- Clear project structures.
- Consistent naming.
- Layer separation.
- Dependency management.
- Reusable services.

Maintainability is a primary architectural objective.

---

# Frontend Architecture

AI-generated Angular applications shall follow:

- Standalone Components
- Feature-based folder organization
- Angular Material
- Reactive Forms
- Lazy-loaded routes
- Shared reusable components
- Centralized services
- Dependency Injection

Business logic shall remain outside presentation components whenever possible.

---

# Mobile Architecture

AI-generated Flutter applications shall follow:

- Clean Architecture
- Repository Pattern
- Feature-based organization
- Dependency Injection
- Approved state management solution
- Reusable widgets
- Separation between UI and business logic

Presentation code should remain independent from data sources.

---

# Backend Architecture

Backend recommendations shall follow:

- Layered Architecture
- RESTful API design
- Service Layer
- Repository Layer
- Authentication Layer
- Validation Layer

Controllers shall remain lightweight and delegate business logic to services.

---

# API Design

AI-generated APIs should:

- Follow REST principles.
- Use meaningful resource names.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Support pagination where required.
- Validate all incoming requests.
- Return standardized error responses.

APIs shall remain predictable and consistent.

---

# Database Design

AI-generated database structures should:

- Follow normalization principles where appropriate.
- Use meaningful table names.
- Enforce referential integrity.
- Avoid redundant data.
- Support indexing strategies.
- Preserve auditability.

Schema design should prioritize data integrity and maintainability.

---

# Dependency Management

Dependencies should remain controlled.

AI should:

- Prefer existing approved libraries.
- Minimize third-party dependencies.
- Avoid deprecated packages.
- Recommend stable technologies.

Every new dependency shall provide measurable value.

---

# State Management

State should be managed predictably.

Frontend applications should:

- Minimize global state.
- Centralize shared state.
- Prevent unnecessary duplication.
- Keep UI state separate from business state.

State management should remain simple and maintainable.

---

# Configuration Management

Configuration values shall be externalized.

Examples include:

- API endpoints
- Environment variables
- Feature flags
- Application settings

Configuration shall never be hardcoded into production source code.

---

# Security Architecture

AI-generated architectures shall incorporate:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Secure communication
- Audit logging
- Least privilege access

Security shall be integrated into every architectural layer.

---

# Error Handling Architecture

Applications should implement centralized error handling.

Requirements include:

- Consistent error responses.
- Structured logging.
- User-friendly messaging.
- Recovery strategies.
- Exception management.

Error handling should remain consistent across all modules.

---

# Logging Architecture

Logging should support:

- System monitoring
- Troubleshooting
- Security investigations
- Audit requirements

Logs should remain structured and exclude sensitive information.

---

# Performance Considerations

AI-generated architectures should:

- Support caching.
- Enable lazy loading.
- Reduce redundant processing.
- Optimize database access.
- Minimize unnecessary API calls.

Performance should be incorporated into architectural decisions from the beginning.

---

# Testability

Architectures should support:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Component testing
- API testing
- End-to-end testing

Modules should be independently testable.

---

# Documentation

Architectural recommendations should include documentation describing:

- System structure
- Module responsibilities
- Data flow
- Integration points
- Key architectural decisions

Architecture documentation shall remain synchronized with implementation.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

AI Architecture Guidelines support:

- AI Development Principles
- AI Coding Standards
- AI Security Guidelines
- AI Testing Guidelines
- Design System
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines

---

# Governance

All AI-generated architectural recommendations within the eBPCO platform shall comply with these guidelines.

Architectural changes shall be reviewed and approved by the System Architect before implementation.
