# Purpose

The AI UI Generation Standards define how Artificial Intelligence (AI) shall generate user interfaces for the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) platform.

These standards ensure that AI-generated interfaces are visually consistent, accessible, responsive, maintainable, and fully aligned with the project's Design System, Brand Guidelines, UX Standards, Mobile Guidelines, and Web Guidelines.

These requirements apply to all AI-generated web and mobile user interfaces.

---

# Objectives

AI-generated user interfaces should:

- Follow the approved Design System.
- Maintain visual consistency.
- Support responsive layouts.
- Comply with accessibility standards.
- Prioritize usability.
- Encourage reusable components.
- Reduce implementation inconsistencies.
- Deliver a professional government user experience.

# UI Generation Principles

## Design System First

AI shall always use the approved eBPCO Design System before introducing new UI patterns.

Generated interfaces shall use:

- Approved colors
- Typography
- Icons
- Buttons
- Cards
- Forms
- Tables
- Navigation components
- Spacing standards

New components shall only be proposed when no existing component satisfies the requirement.

---

## Component Reuse

AI shall prioritize reusable components over custom implementations.

Examples include:

- Buttons
- Form controls
- Dialogs
- Cards
- Tables
- Status badges
- Navigation menus
- Loading indicators

Component duplication should be avoided.

---

## Consistency

Generated interfaces shall maintain consistency across:

- Layouts
- Typography
- Color usage
- Spacing
- Icons
- Interaction patterns
- Navigation
- Feedback mechanisms

Users should experience a familiar interface throughout the application.

---

## Simplicity

Interfaces should remain focused on completing user tasks efficiently.

Avoid:

- Decorative clutter
- Excessive animations
- Redundant controls
- Complex navigation
- Unnecessary dialogs

Every interface element should serve a clear purpose.

---

# Layout Standards

AI-generated layouts shall:

- Follow the approved grid system.
- Respect spacing guidelines.
- Maintain visual hierarchy.
- Support responsive behavior.
- Prevent unnecessary scrolling.

Layouts should prioritize readability and task completion.

---

# Navigation

Generated navigation shall comply with established navigation standards.

Navigation should include:

- Clear page hierarchy
- Consistent menus
- Breadcrumbs where appropriate
- Responsive navigation
- Predictable interaction patterns

Navigation should never confuse users.

---

# Forms

AI-generated forms shall:

- Use approved input components.
- Display visible labels.
- Include helper text where appropriate.
- Validate inputs clearly.
- Preserve entered information.
- Provide accessible error messages.

Forms should minimize user effort.

---

# Data Tables

Generated tables shall support:

- Sorting
- Searching
- Filtering
- Pagination
- Responsive layouts
- Accessible interaction

Large datasets should remain easy to manage.

---

# Dashboards

Dashboard generation shall prioritize:

- Key Performance Indicators
- Quick Actions
- Recent Activity
- Notifications
- Role-based content
- Responsive layouts

Dashboards should provide immediate operational insight.

---

# Visual Hierarchy

Generated interfaces should establish hierarchy using:

- Typography
- Spacing
- Alignment
- Size
- Contrast
- Grouping

Important information should naturally attract user attention.

---

# Responsive Design

Generated interfaces shall support:

Desktop

- Multi-column layouts

Tablet

- Adaptive layouts

Mobile

- Single-column layouts
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive navigation

No functionality shall be lost across supported devices.

---

# Accessibility

AI-generated interfaces shall comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

Requirements include:

- Keyboard navigation
- Visible focus indicators
- Screen reader compatibility
- Semantic markup
- Proper color contrast
- Accessible forms
- Accessible dialogs

Accessibility is mandatory for every generated interface.

---

# Feedback and States

Generated interfaces shall include appropriate feedback.

Required states include:

- Loading
- Success
- Error
- Empty
- Disabled
- Hover
- Focus
- Active

Users should always understand the current system state.

---

# Icons

Icons shall:

- Use the approved icon library.
- Support recognizable meanings.
- Include accessible labels where appropriate.
- Accompany important actions with text.

Icons shall not replace meaningful labels.

---

# Typography

Generated typography shall follow the approved typography scale.

Requirements include:

- Consistent font usage
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Readable body text
- Accessible font sizes
- Appropriate line spacing

Typography should improve readability rather than decoration.

---

# Color Usage

AI shall use only approved colors from the Design System.

Colors should communicate:

- Success
- Warning
- Error
- Information
- Neutral states

Color shall never be the only method of conveying meaning.

---

# Performance

Generated interfaces should:

- Minimize unnecessary rendering.
- Reuse components.
- Optimize images.
- Support lazy loading where appropriate.
- Avoid unnecessary animations.

Performance should remain consistent across supported devices.

---

# Code Generation Requirements

AI-generated UI code shall:

- Follow project folder structure.
- Use approved frameworks.
- Support component reuse.
- Separate presentation from business logic.
- Follow established naming conventions.
- Be fully documented where appropriate.

Generated code should be production-ready after human review.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

AI UI Generation Standards support:

- AI Development Principles
- AI Coding Standards
- AI Architecture Guidelines
- Design System
- Component Library
- UX Standards
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines

---

# Governance

All AI-generated user interfaces within the eBPCO platform shall comply with these standards.

The UI/UX Team and Development Team shall review generated interfaces before implementation to ensure compliance with project requirements and design consistency.
