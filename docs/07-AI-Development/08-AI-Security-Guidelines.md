# Purpose

The AI Security Guidelines establish the security requirements for all Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted development within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) platform.

These guidelines ensure that AI-generated code, documentation, architecture, and recommendations comply with the organization's security standards while protecting government systems, citizen information, business records, and confidential data.

These requirements apply throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

---

# Objectives

AI-assisted development should:

- Protect confidential information.
- Promote secure coding practices.
- Prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Comply with government security policies.
- Support privacy-by-design.
- Strengthen application resilience.
- Maintain public trust.

---

# Security Principles

## Security by Design

Security shall be incorporated from the beginning of every AI-assisted development activity.

AI-generated solutions should consider:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Data protection
- Input validation
- Auditability
- Secure communication

Security shall never be treated as an optional enhancement.

---

## Least Privilege

AI-generated systems shall follow the Principle of Least Privilege.

Applications should provide users, services, and components only the permissions necessary to perform their responsibilities.

Excessive privileges shall be avoided.

---

## Defense in Depth

AI-generated architectures should implement multiple layers of security.

Examples include:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Validation
- Encryption
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Network protection

No single security control should be relied upon exclusively.

---

## Zero Trust Mindset

AI should assume that every request requires verification.

Applications should validate:

- Identity
- Permissions
- Input
- Requests
- Data access

Trust shall never be assumed based solely on network location.

---

# Secure Prompting

Developers shall avoid providing confidential information to AI systems.

Sensitive information includes:

- Passwords
- API keys
- Tokens
- Database credentials
- Internal IP addresses
- Citizen records
- Business records
- Confidential government documents

Only the minimum necessary context should be included in prompts.

---

# Sensitive Information

AI-generated outputs shall never contain:

- Hardcoded credentials
- Authentication secrets
- Encryption keys
- Personal identification numbers
- Payment credentials
- Production database information

Sensitive values shall be stored using approved secret management solutions.

---

# Authentication

AI-generated systems shall support secure authentication mechanisms.

Requirements include:

- Strong password policies
- Secure session management
- Multi-factor authentication where applicable
- Password hashing
- Account lockout policies

Authentication logic shall follow approved organizational standards.

---

# Authorization

Authorization shall be role-based.

AI-generated applications should:

- Restrict access appropriately.
- Validate permissions server-side.
- Hide unauthorized functionality.
- Prevent privilege escalation.

Authorization checks shall never rely solely on client-side validation.

---

# Input Validation

Every external input shall be validated.

Sources include:

- Forms
- APIs
- File uploads
- Query parameters
- Route parameters
- Cookies
- Headers

Validation shall occur before processing.

---

# Output Protection

Generated applications shall protect output by:

- Encoding user-generated content.
- Preventing injection attacks.
- Sanitizing displayed information.
- Preventing information disclosure.

Output shall never expose internal implementation details.

---

# Data Protection

AI-generated systems shall protect data during:

Storage

- Encryption where required
- Access controls
- Audit logging

Transmission

- Secure communication protocols
- Certificate validation
- Protected APIs

Processing

- Least privilege access
- Secure temporary storage
- Controlled data exposure

---

# File Security

File upload functionality shall:

- Validate file type.
- Validate file size.
- Scan for malicious content where applicable.
- Store files securely.
- Restrict executable content.

File downloads shall require proper authorization.

---

# Logging

Security logs should capture:

- Authentication attempts
- Authorization failures
- Sensitive administrative actions
- Security exceptions
- File access
- Configuration changes

Logs shall exclude:

- Passwords
- Tokens
- Secrets
- Personal confidential information

---

# Error Handling

Security-related error messages shall:

- Avoid exposing implementation details.
- Use generic user-facing language.
- Preserve diagnostic information within secure logs.

Internal exceptions shall not be displayed to end users.

---

# Dependency Security

AI should recommend:

- Stable libraries
- Supported package versions
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability monitoring

Deprecated or vulnerable dependencies shall not be introduced.

---

# Security Testing

AI-generated deliverables shall undergo:

- Static analysis
- Dynamic testing
- Dependency scanning
- Authentication testing
- Authorization testing
- Input validation testing
- Penetration testing where applicable

Security validation is mandatory before production deployment.

---

# Incident Response

Security documentation should support:

- Incident reporting
- Audit investigation
- Log analysis
- Root cause analysis
- Recovery procedures

Generated documentation should facilitate rapid incident response.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

AI Security Guidelines support:

- AI Development Principles
- AI Coding Standards
- AI Architecture Guidelines
- AI Testing Guidelines
- Security UX
- Web Guidelines
- Mobile Guidelines

---

# Governance

All AI-assisted development within the eBPCO platform shall comply with these security guidelines.

The Security Team is responsible for reviewing AI-generated deliverables that affect authentication, authorization, sensitive data, infrastructure, or other security-critical components before production approval.
