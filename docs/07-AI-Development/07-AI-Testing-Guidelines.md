# Purpose

The AI Testing Guidelines establish the standards for validating AI-generated software artifacts within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) platform.

Testing ensures that AI-generated code, interfaces, documentation, and architectural recommendations satisfy functional requirements, security expectations, accessibility standards, and enterprise quality requirements before deployment.

These guidelines apply to all AI-assisted development activities.

---

# Objectives

AI-generated deliverables should be:

- Functionally correct.
- Secure.
- Accessible.
- Performant.
- Maintainable.
- Standards-compliant.
- Fully validated before production.

---

# Testing Principles

## Human Verification

Every AI-generated artifact shall undergo human verification.

Developers remain responsible for confirming:

- Functional correctness
- Business rule compliance
- Security
- Accessibility
- Performance
- Code quality

AI shall assist testing—not replace it.

---

## Shift-Left Testing

Testing should begin as early as possible.

AI-generated artifacts should be validated during:

- Planning
- Design
- Development
- Code Review
- Quality Assurance

Early testing reduces project risk.

---

## Repeatability

Testing should be repeatable.

Test cases shall produce consistent results using identical inputs and environments.

Automated testing is encouraged wherever practical.

---

## Risk-Based Testing

Critical government workflows receive the highest testing priority.

Examples include:

- Authentication
- Permit Applications
- Business Registration
- Payments
- Permit Approval
- User Management

Higher-risk functionality requires more comprehensive validation.

---

# Testing Scope

AI-generated outputs requiring validation include:

- Source Code
- UI Components
- APIs
- Documentation
- Database Scripts
- Infrastructure Configuration
- Test Cases
- Architecture Recommendations

---

# Unit Testing

Business logic shall include unit tests.

Unit tests should verify:

- Normal execution
- Boundary conditions
- Invalid inputs
- Error handling
- Expected outputs

Tests should remain independent and deterministic.

---

# Integration Testing

Integration testing shall validate interactions between:

- Frontend and Backend
- Services
- APIs
- Databases
- Authentication Systems
- External Integrations

Integration tests verify complete workflows.

---

# User Interface Testing

AI-generated interfaces shall be tested for:

- Layout consistency
- Responsive behavior
- Form validation
- Navigation
- Accessibility
- Component interaction
- Visual consistency

Interfaces shall comply with the approved Design System.

---

# API Testing

Generated APIs should be tested for:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Request validation
- Response validation
- Error handling
- Performance
- HTTP status codes

Every endpoint should be validated.

---

# Accessibility Testing

AI-generated interfaces shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

Testing includes:

- Keyboard navigation
- Screen readers
- Color contrast
- Focus management
- Semantic markup
- Accessible forms

Accessibility is mandatory.

---

# Security Testing

Generated software shall undergo security validation.

Verify:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Input validation
- File uploads
- Sensitive data handling
- Session management
- Error handling

Security testing shall be completed before production deployment.

---

# Performance Testing

Performance testing should validate:

- Page load time
- API response time
- Database performance
- Rendering efficiency
- Large dataset handling
- Memory usage

Performance targets shall align with project standards.

---

# Regression Testing

Regression testing shall confirm that AI-generated changes do not introduce unintended defects.

Regression testing should include:

- Authentication
- Navigation
- Forms
- Dashboards
- Reports
- Notifications
- Payments
- Permit workflows

Existing functionality shall remain operational.

---

# Test Documentation

Generated testing documentation should include:

- Test objectives
- Preconditions
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results
- Test status

Testing documentation shall remain synchronized with implementation.

---

# Test Automation

Automation is encouraged for:

- Unit tests
- API tests
- UI regression
- Smoke tests
- Accessibility validation

Manual testing remains necessary for usability and exploratory testing.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

AI-generated deliverables shall not be accepted until:

- Functional tests pass.
- Security tests pass.
- Accessibility tests pass.
- Performance targets are met.
- Documentation is complete.
- Human review is approved.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

AI Testing Guidelines support:

- AI Development Principles
- AI Coding Standards
- AI Documentation Standards
- AI Security Guidelines
- Web Guidelines
- Mobile Guidelines
- UX Standards

---

# Governance

All AI-generated deliverables within the eBPCO platform shall comply with these testing guidelines.

The Quality Assurance Team is responsible for validating compliance before production deployment.
