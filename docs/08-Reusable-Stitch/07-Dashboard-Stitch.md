# 07 – Dashboard Stitch

## Overview

The Dashboard Stitch defines the main landing page of the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application after a user successfully signs in.

The dashboard serves as the user's command center, providing quick access to business permit services, application status, notifications, recent activities, and account information.

It is designed to provide important information at a glance while minimizing the number of taps required to complete common tasks.
