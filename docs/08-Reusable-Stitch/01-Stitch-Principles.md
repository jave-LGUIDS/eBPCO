# Purpose

This document establishes the principles that govern the design, creation, implementation, and maintenance of reusable stitches within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO).

A Reusable Stitch is a standardized application building block that combines reusable UI components, navigation, business logic, user interactions, permissions, and workflow definitions into a modular unit that can be assembled to build complete applications.

Rather than designing every feature independently, eBPCO is constructed by composing reusable stitches.

---

# Definition

A Reusable Stitch is a self-contained blueprint that defines:

- Purpose
- User Goal
- Workflow
- Navigation
- User Interface
- Components
- Business Rules
- Permissions
- Screen States
- Inputs
- Outputs

Each stitch represents one reusable capability within the application.

---

# Objectives

The Reusable Stitch Framework aims to:

- Standardize application development.
- Promote component reuse.
- Reduce duplicated work.
- Improve consistency across Web and Mobile.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Accelerate AI-assisted development.
- Support scalable application architecture.
- Ensure predictable user experiences.

---

# Core Principles

## 1. Single Responsibility

Each stitch shall solve one business capability.

Examples include:

- Authentication
- Dashboard
- Business Registration
- Permit Application
- Payment
- Notifications
- Profile Management

A stitch should not attempt to solve unrelated business problems.

---

## 2. Modular Composition

Applications shall be assembled from multiple stitches.

Example:

```text
Authentication Stitch
        │
        ▼
Dashboard Stitch
        │
        ▼
Permit Application Stitch
        │
        ▼
Payment Stitch
        │
        ▼
Tracking Stitch
```

Each stitch should remain independently understandable and reusable.

---

## 3. Reusable Components

Every stitch shall be built using approved components from the Component Library.

Examples:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Forms
- Tables
- Dialogs
- Navigation
- Chips
- Progress Indicators
- File Upload Controls

Creating duplicate components is discouraged unless justified by new requirements.

---

## 4. Platform Independence

A stitch defines functionality—not implementation.

The same stitch should be implementable using:

- Angular
- Flutter
- Future supported platforms

Business behavior must remain consistent regardless of technology.

---

## 5. Consistent User Experience

Every stitch shall follow:

- Brand Guidelines
- Design System
- UX Standards
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines

Users should experience one unified system.

---

## 6. AI Readability

Every stitch should be structured so AI development tools can understand and generate implementations consistently.

Each stitch shall define:

- Purpose
- Components
- Navigation
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Business Rules
- States
- Permissions

This reduces ambiguity during AI-assisted development.

---

## 7. State Completeness

Every stitch shall document all interface states.

Minimum required states include:

- Initial
- Loading
- Empty
- Success
- Validation Error
- System Error
- Disabled
- Offline (if applicable)

No user-visible state should be undocumented.

---

## 8. Role Awareness

Every stitch shall clearly identify which user roles can access it.

Example roles include:

- Business Owner
- Evaluator
- Inspector
- Payment Officer
- Administrator
- Super Administrator

Role-based behavior shall be explicitly documented.

---

## 9. Workflow Driven

A stitch represents a complete user workflow rather than an isolated screen.

For example, the Permit Application Stitch includes:

- Business selection
- Permit form
- Validation
- Document upload
- Submission
- Confirmation

Multiple screens may belong to one stitch if they represent a single workflow.

---

## 10. Extensibility

New features should extend existing stitches whenever practical.

Only create a new stitch when:

- A new business capability is introduced.
- Existing stitches become overly complex.
- Reuse is no longer practical.

---

## 11. Security by Design

Every stitch shall incorporate security considerations from the outset.

Examples include:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Secure data handling
- File validation
- Session management
- Input validation

Security requirements shall be part of the stitch specification.

---

## 12. Documentation First

Every stitch shall be documented before implementation.

Documentation should include:

- Functional description
- UI structure
- Navigation
- Components
- Business rules
- States
- Permissions
- Acceptance criteria

Documentation serves as the single source of truth for designers, developers, QA engineers, and AI tools.

---

# Stitch Structure

Each reusable stitch should contain the following sections:

1. Purpose
2. User Goal
3. Business Context
4. Entry Points
5. Exit Points
6. Navigation
7. UI Layout
8. Components
9. Business Rules
10. Inputs
11. Outputs
12. Validation Rules
13. Permissions
14. States
15. Error Handling
16. Acceptance Criteria

This structure ensures consistency across all stitches.

---

# Relationship to Other Documentation

The Reusable Stitch Framework builds upon:

- Brand Guidelines
- Design System
- Component Library
- UX Standards
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines
- AI Development Standards

These documents define *how* interfaces should be designed, while stitches define *how* they are assembled into complete business workflows.

---

# Governance

All new stitches shall undergo review by the System Architect, UI/UX Team, and Development Team before implementation.

Changes to existing stitches shall be version-controlled and documented to maintain consistency across the platform.
