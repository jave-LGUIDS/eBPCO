# Purpose

Touch Interactions define the standards for how users physically interact with the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application using touch-based devices.

These guidelines ensure that all interactions are intuitive, responsive, accessible, and optimized for modern smartphones and tablets while providing a consistent experience throughout the application.

This specification applies to the Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Touch interactions should:

- Feel natural and responsive.
- Minimize accidental touches.
- Support one-handed operation.
- Provide immediate visual feedback.
- Improve accessibility.
- Maintain consistency across the application.

---

# Touch Interaction Principles

## Direct Manipulation

Users should interact directly with interface elements.

Examples

- Tap buttons
- Select list items
- Toggle switches
- Drag sliders

Interactions should feel immediate and predictable.

---

## Immediate Feedback

Every touch interaction shall produce immediate feedback.

Examples

- Ripple animation
- Button elevation
- Color change
- Loading indicator
- Haptic feedback (where appropriate)

Users should never question whether a touch was recognized.

---

## Forgiveness

Interfaces should minimize the impact of accidental touches.

Examples

- Confirmation before deleting
- Undo actions
- Large touch targets
- Adequate spacing

Critical actions should require deliberate user intent.

---

## Consistency

Touch gestures should behave consistently throughout the application.

Example

A tap should always activate an element.

A swipe should always perform the documented action.

Interaction behavior should never change unexpectedly.

---

# Touch Target Size

Minimum touch target

44 × 44 px

Recommended touch target

48 × 48 px

Interactive controls include:

- Buttons
- Icons
- Menu Items
- Checkboxes
- Radio Buttons
- Switches
- Floating Action Buttons

Smaller controls shall include additional invisible touch padding.

---

# Spacing Between Controls

Interactive elements should have sufficient spacing to prevent accidental taps.

Recommended minimum spacing

8 px

Preferred spacing

12–16 px

Spacing should increase in areas with multiple actions.

---

# Tap Interactions

A single tap is the primary interaction method.

Examples

- Open Application
- Submit Form
- View Details
- Expand Card

Tap interactions should complete within 100 milliseconds whenever possible.

---

# Double Tap

Double tap should generally be avoided unless users clearly expect the behavior.

Examples of acceptable use

- Zooming images
- Maps

Government service workflows should rely on single-tap interactions.

---

# Long Press

Long press should reveal secondary actions only.

Examples

- Context menu
- Additional options
- Selection mode

Primary actions should never require a long press.

---

# Swipe Gestures

Swipe gestures should enhance usability without hiding essential functionality.

Examples

- Swipe to refresh
- Swipe between tabs
- Swipe to dismiss notifications

Users should never be required to discover hidden swipe gestures to complete mandatory tasks.

---

# Drag and Drop

Drag interactions should only be used where they provide clear value.

Examples

- Reordering lists
- Moving items (future functionality)

Drag interactions should include visual feedback throughout the movement.

---

# Scrolling

Vertical scrolling is the preferred navigation pattern.

Avoid

- Horizontal scrolling
- Nested scrolling
- Conflicting gesture areas

Scrolling should remain smooth and responsive.

---

# Haptic Feedback

Where supported, subtle haptic feedback may be used for:

- Successful actions
- Important confirmations
- Authentication
- Toggle changes

Haptic feedback should enhance—not replace—visual feedback.

---

# Gesture Conflicts

Avoid assigning multiple actions to the same gesture.

Example

A swipe should not simultaneously:

- Delete
- Archive
- Open Details

Each gesture should have a single, predictable outcome.

---

# Disabled Controls

Disabled controls should:

- Be visually distinguishable.
- Ignore touch interactions.
- Explain why the action is unavailable when appropriate.

Users should understand how to enable the action.

---

# Accessibility

Touch interactions shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Support assistive technologies.
- Maintain minimum touch target sizes.
- Avoid gesture-only functionality.
- Provide alternatives for complex gestures.

Every action available through gestures should also be accessible through standard controls.

---

# Responsive Behavior

Small Phones

- Larger touch targets.
- Increased spacing.

Large Phones

- Comfortable thumb reach.
- Improved gesture areas.

Tablets

- Larger interaction regions.
- Additional whitespace.

Touch behavior should remain consistent regardless of screen size.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Touch Interactions support:

- Mobile Design Principles
- Navigation Patterns
- Mobile Layouts
- Mobile Accessibility
- Responsive UX
- Component Library

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated mobile interfaces must:

- Use approved touch target sizes.
- Preserve consistent gesture behavior.
- Avoid hidden interactions for critical tasks.
- Provide immediate visual feedback.
- Support accessibility alternatives.
- Minimize accidental user actions.

AI should design interactions that feel intuitive, reliable, and aligned with modern mobile platform conventions.

---

# Governance

All touch interactions within the eBPCO mobile application shall comply with this specification.

Changes to gesture behavior or touch interaction patterns require approval from the UI/UX Team before implementation.
