# Purpose

The Mobile Testing Checklist establishes the minimum quality assurance requirements for the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application before every release.

This checklist ensures that all mobile features meet the organization's standards for functionality, usability, accessibility, security, performance, and reliability across supported Android devices.

This document serves as the final validation guide before deployment to production.
