# Purpose

The Mobile Design Principles establish the foundational philosophy for designing the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application.

These principles ensure that every mobile interface is intuitive, efficient, accessible, and consistent while taking advantage of modern mobile capabilities and adhering to government service standards.

This specification applies to the Flutter Mobile Application and future mobile platforms supported by eBPCO.

---

# Objectives

Mobile design should:

- Prioritize essential user tasks.
- Deliver a fast and responsive experience.
- Optimize for touch interaction.
- Maintain consistency across the application.
- Support accessibility by default.
- Minimize user effort.
- Build trust through predictable behavior.

---

# Mobile Design Principles

## Mobile First

Design should begin with the smallest supported screen before expanding to larger devices.

Interfaces should prioritize essential content and actions while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

---

## Task-Oriented Design

Every screen should support a clear user objective.

Examples

- Apply for a Business Permit
- Renew a Permit
- Upload Documents
- Pay Fees
- Track Application Status

Avoid presenting unrelated actions that distract users from their primary task.

---

## Simplicity

Interfaces should display only the information necessary for the current task.

Avoid:

- excessive menus
- crowded layouts
- redundant information
- unnecessary visual elements

A simple interface improves comprehension and completion rates.

---

## Thumb-Friendly Interaction

Frequently used controls should be placed within comfortable reach.

Examples

- Primary actions near the bottom of the screen
- Large touch targets
- Comfortable spacing between controls

Design should minimize hand repositioning.

---

## Consistency

Navigation, components, terminology, colors, and interaction patterns should remain consistent throughout the application.

Users should never have to relearn how to complete common tasks.

---

## Progressive Disclosure

Present advanced information only when required.

Example

Business Information

↓

Additional Business Details

↓

Supporting Documents

↓

Review & Submit

Breaking large tasks into manageable steps reduces cognitive load.

---

## Immediate Feedback

Every user action should receive an immediate response.

Examples

- Button press animation
- Loading indicator
- Success message
- Validation feedback

Users should always know that their action has been received.

---

## Performance Awareness

The interface should remain responsive even on lower-end devices and slower network connections.

Design should minimize unnecessary processing, rendering, and network requests.

---

## Accessibility by Default

Accessibility should be considered from the beginning of the design process.

Interfaces shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA where applicable.
- Support screen readers.
- Maintain readable typography.
- Provide sufficient contrast.
- Support large touch targets.

Accessibility is a core requirement, not an enhancement.

---

# Mobile UX Goals

The mobile application should enable users to:

- Complete tasks quickly.
- Understand application status.
- Recover easily from mistakes.
- Navigate confidently.
- Access services anywhere.
- Use the application comfortably with one hand where practical.

---

# Layout Philosophy

Mobile layouts should emphasize:

- Vertical scrolling
- Clear content hierarchy
- Generous spacing
- Full-width interactive controls
- Minimal visual clutter

Content should remain readable without zooming.

---

# Navigation Philosophy

Navigation should be:

- Predictable
- Consistent
- Easy to reach
- Limited to essential destinations

Primary navigation should remain visible or easily accessible throughout the application.

---

# Content Philosophy

Content should:

- Use plain language.
- Be concise.
- Highlight important information first.
- Reduce reading effort.
- Support government terminology where required.

---

# Trust and Transparency

The application should build user confidence by:

- Clearly communicating system status.
- Displaying confirmation messages.
- Showing application progress.
- Explaining errors in understandable language.
- Providing reference numbers after successful submissions.

Trust is especially important for government digital services.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Mobile Design Principles support:

- UX Standards
- Design System
- Component Library
- Mobile Accessibility
- Mobile Forms
- Responsive Behavior

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated mobile interfaces must:

- Follow these Mobile Design Principles.
- Prioritize task completion.
- Reuse approved Design System components.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns.
- Avoid unnecessary visual complexity.
- Optimize layouts for touch interaction.

AI should generate interfaces that feel native to modern mobile applications while remaining consistent with the eBPCO design language.

---

# Governance

All mobile interfaces within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with these Mobile Design Principles.

Changes to these principles require review and approval from the UI/UX Team before implementation.
