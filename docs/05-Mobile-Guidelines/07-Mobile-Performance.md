# Purpose

Mobile Performance defines the standards for delivering a fast, responsive, and reliable user experience throughout the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application.

Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, task completion, and trust in government digital services. Every screen, interaction, and workflow should be optimized to minimize waiting time and maximize responsiveness.

This specification applies to the Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Mobile performance should:

- Minimize loading times.
- Maintain smooth interactions.
- Optimize resource usage.
- Reduce network dependency.
- Improve battery efficiency.
- Support lower-end Android devices.
- Deliver a responsive government service experience.

---

# Performance Principles

## Fast First Impression

The application should become interactive as quickly as possible.

Users should immediately see:

- Application branding
- Loading indicators
- Skeleton screens
- Essential content

Avoid blank screens during startup.

---

## Perceived Performance

Users should feel that the application is responsive even when background processing is occurring.

Recommended techniques include:

- Skeleton loading
- Progressive rendering
- Optimistic UI updates
- Incremental loading

Perceived responsiveness is as important as actual speed.

---

## Efficient Rendering

Screens should render only what is necessary.

Avoid:

- Rendering hidden widgets
- Excessive widget rebuilding
- Deep widget trees
- Unnecessary animations

Efficient rendering improves responsiveness and battery life.

---

## Network Optimization

Applications should minimize network requests.

Recommended practices:

- Request only necessary data.
- Batch API requests where possible.
- Cache frequently used information.
- Avoid duplicate requests.

The application should remain usable under slow network conditions.

---

# Loading States

Loading indicators should be displayed whenever content is unavailable.

Approved loading patterns include:

- Skeleton Screens
- Circular Progress Indicators
- Linear Progress Indicators
- Loading Placeholders

Loading indicators should communicate that the application is actively processing.

---

# Data Loading

Large datasets should be loaded incrementally.

Examples

- Applications
- Notifications
- Reports
- Transaction History

Use:

- Pagination
- Infinite Scrolling
- Lazy Loading

Avoid loading unnecessary records during initial screen rendering.

---

# Image Optimization

Images should:

- Use appropriate resolutions.
- Be compressed without noticeable quality loss.
- Load asynchronously.
- Cache when appropriate.

Large images should never block screen rendering.

---

# Caching

The application should cache frequently accessed data.

Recommended cache candidates:

- User Profile
- Application Status
- Business Information
- Reference Data
- Settings

Cached data should be refreshed intelligently when connectivity is available.

---

# Offline Readiness

Where practical, previously loaded information should remain available offline.

Examples

- User profile
- Submitted applications
- Reference numbers
- Saved drafts

Offline support improves reliability in areas with limited connectivity.

---

# Animation Performance

Animations should remain smooth.

Recommended frame rate:

60 FPS

Animations should:

- Be short.
- Avoid excessive motion.
- Never delay user interaction.

Performance takes priority over decorative effects.

---

# Battery Efficiency

The application should minimize battery consumption.

Avoid:

- Continuous background processing
- Excessive location updates
- Frequent network polling
- Unnecessary animations

Background tasks should execute only when required.

---

# Memory Management

The application should:

- Dispose unused resources.
- Release image memory.
- Avoid memory leaks.
- Minimize object creation during scrolling.

Efficient memory usage improves stability on lower-end devices.

---

# Error Recovery

Performance issues should never result in data loss.

If processing fails:

- Preserve user input.
- Allow retry.
- Display meaningful feedback.
- Resume interrupted operations where possible.

---

# Accessibility

Performance optimizations shall not reduce accessibility.

Applications shall continue to support:

- Screen readers
- Large text
- High contrast
- Reduced motion
- Keyboard navigation (where applicable)

Performance improvements should benefit all users.

---

# Performance Targets

Recommended performance goals:

Application Launch

Less than 3 seconds

Screen Transition

Less than 300 milliseconds

Touch Response

Less than 100 milliseconds

Loading Indicator Appearance

Immediately after user action

These targets should guide optimization efforts.

---

# Performance Testing

Performance testing should include:

- Cold Start Testing
- Warm Start Testing
- Memory Usage Analysis
- Battery Consumption
- CPU Utilization
- Frame Rendering Analysis
- Slow Network Simulation
- Offline Testing

Performance should be evaluated on entry-level Android devices in addition to flagship devices.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Mobile Performance supports:

- Mobile Design Principles
- Mobile Layouts
- Responsive Behavior
- Offline Experience
- Mobile Accessibility
- UX Standards

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated mobile interfaces must:

- Optimize widget rendering.
- Reuse existing components.
- Minimize unnecessary rebuilds.
- Support lazy loading.
- Display appropriate loading states.
- Optimize image handling.
- Preserve accessibility while improving performance.

AI should prioritize responsive, efficient interfaces that perform well across a wide range of Android devices.

---

# Governance

All mobile interfaces within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with this Mobile Performance specification.

Performance benchmarks shall be validated before production releases.

Any deviations from the recommended performance targets require review and approval from the UI/UX Team and Development Team.
