# Purpose

Mobile Security UX defines the user experience standards for security-related interactions within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application.

Security should protect users, business information, and government services while remaining understandable, transparent, and minimally disruptive. Every security feature should increase user confidence without creating unnecessary complexity.

This specification applies to the Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Mobile security should:

- Protect user accounts and personal information.
- Secure government transactions.
- Build user trust through transparent communication.
- Minimize user frustration.
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Support secure authentication.
- Balance usability with security requirements.

---

# Security Principles

## Security by Design

Security shall be incorporated into every workflow from the beginning rather than added later.

Security measures should be integrated naturally into the user experience.

---

## Transparency

Users should understand:

- Why information is requested.
- Why permissions are needed.
- Why authentication is required.
- What happens to submitted information.

Security actions should never appear suspicious or unexplained.

---

## Least Friction

Security measures should protect users while minimizing unnecessary interruptions.

Examples

Good

Require authentication before viewing sensitive permit information.

Bad

Require repeated authentication during a single trusted session.

---

## Privacy First

Users shall maintain control over their personal information.

The application should:

- Clearly explain data collection.
- Limit information requests.
- Respect user consent.
- Protect sensitive information.

---

# Authentication

Users shall authenticate using approved account credentials.

Supported authentication methods may include:

- Email and Password
- Mobile Number and Password
- Biometric Authentication (optional)

Authentication should use secure backend validation.

---

# Session Management

User sessions should:

- Automatically expire after extended inactivity.
- Require re-authentication for sensitive actions.
- Preserve unsaved work whenever possible.
- Notify users before session expiration when appropriate.

Unexpected session termination should be minimized.

---

# Password Requirements

Passwords should:

- Meet organizational security requirements.
- Support secure password creation.
- Encourage strong passwords.

Password fields should include:

- Show/Hide Password
- Password strength guidance
- Clear validation messages

Passwords shall never be displayed in plain text by default.

---

# Multi-Factor Authentication

Future versions may support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Supported methods may include:

- One-Time Password (OTP)
- Authenticator Application
- Verified Email
- Verified Mobile Number

MFA should be optional unless required by organizational policy.

---

# Biometric Authentication

Where supported, biometric authentication may be used for convenience.

Supported methods include:

- Fingerprint
- Face Authentication

Biometric authentication shall:

- Require prior account authentication.
- Respect device security settings.
- Allow users to disable biometric login.

---

# Sensitive Information

Sensitive information includes:

- Personal Information
- Business Information
- Government Documents
- Uploaded Files
- Payment References

Sensitive information should:

- Be masked where appropriate.
- Never appear in notifications.
- Never be unnecessarily exposed on screen.

---

# Secure Forms

Forms handling sensitive information should:

- Use secure input fields.
- Validate data before submission.
- Prevent duplicate submissions.
- Preserve information safely during interruptions.

Sensitive fields should never be auto-filled unless explicitly supported by the operating system.

---

# Permission Requests

Permission requests should:

- Occur only when necessary.
- Explain why access is required.
- Provide clear user choices.
- Respect denied permissions.

Permissions shall not be requested during application startup unless essential.

---

# Error Messages

Security-related error messages should:

- Explain the issue clearly.
- Avoid revealing sensitive system information.
- Suggest corrective actions.

Example

Incorrect email or password.

Avoid

User account does not exist.

Messages should not disclose information that could aid unauthorized users.

---

# Logout

Users shall have access to a clearly visible Logout option.

Logging out should:

- End the active session.
- Remove authentication tokens.
- Protect locally stored sensitive information.
- Return the user to the login screen.

Logout should not delete locally saved drafts unless requested.

---

# Payment Security

For payment workflows:

- Use secure payment providers.
- Display payment status clearly.
- Confirm successful transactions.
- Prevent duplicate payments.
- Protect payment reference numbers.

Users should always receive confirmation after successful payment.

---

# Security Notifications

Users should receive notifications for significant account events.

Examples

- Successful Login
- Password Changed
- Profile Updated
- New Device Login
- Password Reset

Notifications should avoid exposing confidential information.

---

# Privacy Notices

Privacy information should be:

- Easy to locate.
- Written in plain language.
- Presented before collecting personal information.

Users should understand:

- What information is collected.
- Why it is collected.
- How it is protected.
- How it is used.

---

# Accessibility

Security features shall remain fully accessible.

They should:

- Support screen readers.
- Maintain logical navigation.
- Provide descriptive labels.
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Avoid inaccessible CAPTCHA mechanisms where possible.

Security should never reduce accessibility.

---

# Performance

Security measures should:

- Authenticate efficiently.
- Minimize waiting time.
- Avoid unnecessary network requests.
- Preserve application responsiveness.

Users should experience minimal delays during secure operations.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Mobile Security UX supports:

- Device Integration
- Offline Experience
- Mobile Accessibility
- Mobile Performance
- UX Standards
- Security Policies

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated mobile interfaces must:

- Follow secure authentication patterns.
- Never expose sensitive information.
- Use approved security components.
- Request permissions only when necessary.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Prevent duplicate submissions.
- Display secure and user-friendly error messages.

AI should prioritize user trust, privacy, and security without compromising usability.

---

# Governance

All security-related user experiences within the eBPCO mobile application shall comply with this specification.

Changes affecting authentication, permissions, privacy, or secure workflows require review and approval by the UI/UX Team, Development Team, and Information Security Team.
