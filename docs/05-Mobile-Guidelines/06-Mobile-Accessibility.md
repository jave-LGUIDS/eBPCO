# Purpose

Mobile Accessibility defines the standards for ensuring that the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application is usable by everyone, including persons with disabilities (PWDs), senior citizens, users with temporary impairments, and users with varying levels of digital literacy.

Accessibility shall be considered a fundamental design and development requirement throughout the Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Mobile accessibility should:

- Ensure equal access to government services.
- Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
- Support Android accessibility services.
- Improve usability for all users.
- Support assistive technologies.
- Reduce barriers during task completion.
- Maintain accessibility across all devices.

# Accessibility Principles

The eBPCO mobile application follows the four WCAG accessibility principles:

## Perceivable

Information must be presented in ways users can perceive.

Examples

- High color contrast
- Descriptive icons
- Readable typography
- Alternative text
- Visible labels

---

## Operable

Users must be able to operate every feature regardless of input method.

Examples

- Touch
- External keyboard
- Screen readers
- Voice access
- Switch devices

No essential feature shall depend on a single interaction method.

---

## Understandable

Interfaces should be predictable and easy to understand.

Examples

- Consistent navigation
- Clear instructions
- Helpful validation
- Plain language
- Familiar interaction patterns

---

## Robust

The application shall remain compatible with current and future assistive technologies.

Examples

- Flutter Semantics
- Android TalkBack
- Voice Access
- Screen Magnification
- Accessibility APIs

---

# Compliance

The mobile application shall comply with:

- WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- Android Accessibility Guidelines
- Flutter Accessibility Best Practices

Future updates should consider WCAG 2.2 recommendations.

---

# Touch Targets

Minimum touch target

44 × 44 px

Recommended touch target

48 × 48 px

Touch targets include:

- Buttons
- Icons
- Switches
- Checkboxes
- Radio Buttons
- Navigation Items
- Floating Action Buttons

Spacing between controls should prevent accidental activation.

---

# Typography

Text shall remain readable.

Recommended minimum sizes

Body Text

16 px

Secondary Text

14 px

Headings

20–32 px

Users should be able to increase text size using system accessibility settings without breaking layouts.

---

# Color and Contrast

Color shall never be the only method of communicating information.

Minimum contrast ratios

Normal Text

4.5 : 1

Large Text

3 : 1

Interactive Elements

3 : 1 minimum

Examples

Good

Essential information shall never depend solely on animation.

---

# Time Limits

Where workflows include time limits:
