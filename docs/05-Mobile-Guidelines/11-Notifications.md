# Purpose

Notifications define the standards for delivering timely, relevant, and actionable information to users of the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application.

Notifications should improve communication between the government and users without becoming intrusive or overwhelming. Every notification should provide clear value and encourage users to take appropriate action when necessary.

This specification applies to the Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Notifications should:

- Keep users informed of important events.
- Support timely completion of government transactions.
- Encourage user engagement.
- Build trust through transparent communication.
- Minimize unnecessary interruptions.
- Respect user notification preferences.
- Deliver accurate and relevant information.

---

# Notification Principles

## Relevance

Every notification shall serve a legitimate business purpose.

Examples include:

- Permit application updates
- Payment confirmations
- Renewal reminders
- Required document requests
- Scheduled maintenance announcements

Notifications shall never be sent for promotional purposes unrelated to government services.

---

## Timeliness

Notifications should be delivered as close as possible to the event that triggered them.

Examples

- Payment confirmation immediately after successful payment.
- Application approval immediately after approval.
- Renewal reminder before permit expiration.

Delayed notifications reduce user confidence.

---

## Clarity

Notifications should answer three questions:

- What happened?
- Why does it matter?
- What should the user do next?

Messages should use plain language and avoid technical terminology.

---

## Actionability

Whenever possible, notifications should include a clear next step.

Examples

- View Application
- Upload Required Documents
- Complete Payment
- View Official Receipt

Notifications without meaningful actions should be avoided.

---

# Notification Categories

## Transaction Notifications

Examples

- Application Submitted
- Application Under Review
- Application Approved
- Application Rejected
- Additional Requirements Requested
- Permit Ready for Release

These notifications directly support government transactions.

---

## Payment Notifications

Examples

- Payment Successful
- Payment Pending Verification
- Payment Failed
- Official Receipt Available

Payment notifications should always include the payment reference number when appropriate.

---

## Reminder Notifications

Examples

- Business Permit Renewal Reminder
- Pending Document Submission
- Incomplete Draft Application
- Scheduled Appointment Reminder

Reminder timing should support successful task completion without excessive repetition.

---

## System Notifications

Examples

- Scheduled System Maintenance
- Service Interruption
- Application Update Available
- Security Advisory

System notifications should be reserved for important operational updates.

---

# Notification Content

Every notification should include:

- Title
- Brief description
- Timestamp
- Related transaction (if applicable)
- Action button or destination (when applicable)

Example

# Notification Priority

## High Priority

Reserved for:

- Application Approved
- Payment Confirmation
- Security Alerts
- Required Immediate Action

High-priority notifications should be used sparingly.

---

## Normal Priority

Examples

- Renewal Reminder
- Draft Reminder
- General Status Update

These notifications should not unnecessarily interrupt users.

---

## Low Priority

Examples

Selecting a notification should open the most relevant screen.

Users should never be redirected to unrelated screens.

---

# Notification History

The application should maintain a notification history.

Each notification should display:

- Read status
- Timestamp
- Notification category
- Related application (if applicable)

Users should be able to review previous notifications at any time.

---

# Read and Unread States

Unread notifications should be visually distinguishable.

Once viewed, notifications should automatically be marked as read.

Users may also manually mark notifications as read.

---

# User Preferences

Users should be able to manage notification preferences where appropriate.

Examples

Enable or disable:

Critical security and legal notifications should remain mandatory.

---

# Privacy

Notifications shall never expose sensitive personal information on the device lock screen.

Avoid displaying:

- Confidential business information

Sensitive details should only be visible after user authentication.

---

# Accessibility

Notifications shall:

- Support screen readers.
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.

- Avoid relying solely on icons or colors.
- Provide sufficient text contrast.

Accessible notifications improve usability for all users.

---

# Performance

Notification delivery should:

- Be timely.
- Avoid duplicate messages.
- Minimize battery consumption.
- Function reliably under varying network conditions.

Notification services should not negatively impact application performance.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Notifications support:

- Mobile Security UX

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated notification content must:

- Use plain, concise language.
- Deliver only relevant notifications.
- Include clear user actions where appropriate.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information.
- Support accessibility standards.
- Follow approved notification categories and priorities.

AI should generate notifications that improve user awareness without causing unnecessary distraction.
