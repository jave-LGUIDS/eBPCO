# Purpose

Responsive Behavior defines how the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) mobile application adapts to different device sizes, screen orientations, resolutions, and display configurations while maintaining a consistent and accessible user experience.

The application shall provide an optimized interface across supported Android smartphones and tablets without compromising usability, performance, or accessibility.

This specification applies to the Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Responsive behavior should:

- Provide a consistent user experience across devices.
- Maximize usability on different screen sizes.
- Prevent layout breakage.
- Support portrait and landscape orientations where appropriate.
- Maintain accessibility and readability.
- Ensure efficient use of available screen space.

---

# Responsive Design Principles

## Mobile-First Design

The application shall be designed for small mobile devices first before scaling to larger screens.

Design priorities include:

- Essential content first
- Simplified navigation
- Efficient touch interactions
- Progressive enhancement

Additional space on larger devices should improve usability rather than increase complexity.

---

## Flexible Layouts

User interfaces shall adapt dynamically to available screen space.

Layouts should:

- Expand naturally.
- Avoid fixed-width elements.
- Preserve spacing consistency.
- Prevent overlapping components.

Flutter layout widgets should prioritize flexibility over absolute positioning.

---

## Consistent User Experience

Users should recognize the same workflows regardless of device.

Examples

- Navigation remains familiar.
- Forms follow identical processes.
- Status indicators remain consistent.
- Component behavior does not change unexpectedly.

Only presentation should change—not functionality.

---

# Supported Screen Sizes

The application shall support common Android device categories.

## Small Phones

Approximate Width

320–360 dp

Design considerations

- Compact spacing
- Larger touch targets
- Single-column layouts
- Reduced visual clutter

---

## Standard Phones

Approximate Width

360–480 dp

Design considerations

- Standard spacing
- Comfortable reading width
- Full mobile navigation

---

## Large Phones

Approximate Width

480–600 dp

Design considerations

- Additional whitespace
- Larger content areas
- Improved readability

---

## Tablets

Approximate Width

600 dp and above

Design considerations

- Expanded margins
- Larger typography where appropriate
- Increased spacing
- Efficient use of horizontal space

Core workflows should remain familiar across all devices.

---

# Orientation Support

## Portrait

Portrait orientation shall be the primary layout for all government workflows.

Examples

- Login
- Registration
- Business Permit Application
- Payment
- Application Tracking

---

## Landscape

Landscape orientation should be supported where it improves usability.

Examples

- Viewing documents
- Reviewing uploaded images
- Reading lengthy content
- Tablet usage

Critical workflows shall remain functional after orientation changes.

---

# Layout Adaptation

Layouts should adapt without:

- Horizontal scrolling
- Cropped content
- Hidden actions
- Overlapping components
- Distorted images

Users should never lose access to essential controls.

---

# Typography Scaling

Typography shall remain readable across all supported devices.

Text should:

- Respect system font scaling.
- Maintain hierarchy.
- Prevent clipping.
- Wrap naturally.

Content shall remain usable with increased accessibility font sizes.

---

# Images and Media

Images should:

- Scale proportionally.
- Preserve aspect ratio.
- Avoid stretching.
- Load optimized versions where appropriate.

Media should never distort the interface.

---

# Forms

Responsive forms shall:

- Remain single-column on phones.
- Expand spacing on tablets.
- Preserve logical field order.
- Maintain accessible touch targets.
- Prevent keyboard overlap.

Users should complete forms comfortably on any supported device.

---

# Navigation

Navigation should adapt according to available screen space.

Examples

Phones

- Bottom Navigation
- Navigation Drawer
- App Bar

Tablets

- Expanded Navigation Rail
- Persistent Navigation Panel (future enhancement)

Navigation behavior should remain predictable.

---

# Dialogs

Dialogs shall:

- Resize appropriately.
- Remain centered.
- Avoid covering critical content.
- Support scrolling when necessary.

Dialogs should never exceed available screen boundaries.

---

# Safe Areas

Layouts shall respect device safe areas including:

- Display cutouts
- Camera holes
- Rounded corners
- Gesture navigation areas
- System status bars

Interactive controls shall never overlap restricted display areas.

---

# Foldable Devices

Where supported, layouts should:

- Adapt to folding states.
- Preserve user progress.
- Avoid layout distortion.
- Utilize additional screen space effectively.

Future enhancements should consider Android foldable design guidelines.

---

# Accessibility

Responsive layouts shall continue to support:

- WCAG 2.1 AA
- Screen readers
- Large text
- High contrast
- Keyboard navigation
- Touch accessibility

Responsiveness shall never reduce accessibility.

---

# Performance

Responsive behavior should:

- Minimize layout recalculations.
- Avoid unnecessary widget rebuilding.
- Optimize rendering for different screen sizes.
- Maintain smooth transitions during orientation changes.

Performance shall remain consistent across supported devices.

---

# Testing Requirements

Responsive behavior shall be tested using:

Device Categories

- Small Phones
- Standard Phones
- Large Phones
- Tablets

Orientation Testing

- Portrait
- Landscape

Accessibility Testing

- Large Font Sizes
- Screen Readers
- High Contrast

Performance Testing

- Layout rendering
- Orientation changes
- Screen resizing

Responsive testing shall be included in every release cycle.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Responsive Behavior supports:

- Mobile Design Principles
- Mobile Layouts
- Mobile Accessibility
- Mobile Performance
- Touch Interactions
- Design System

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated mobile interfaces must:

- Follow mobile-first design principles.
- Generate flexible layouts.
- Avoid fixed dimensions.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Support all approved device categories.
- Respect safe areas.
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns.

AI should generate interfaces that adapt seamlessly across supported Android devices while preserving usability and performance.
