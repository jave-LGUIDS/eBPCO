# Purpose

Floating Action Buttons (FABs) represent the primary action available on a screen. They are visually prominent and remain accessible while users interact with page content.

FABs should be used sparingly and only when there is a single, high-priority action users are expected to perform frequently.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Floating Action Buttons should:

- Emphasize the primary screen action.
- Remain easily accessible during interaction.
- Provide immediate visual feedback.
- Support accessibility requirements.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.
- Be implemented as reusable shared components.

---

# Usage

Use Floating Action Buttons only when a screen has one dominant action.

Recommended examples:

- New Business Permit Application
- Create Announcement
- Add Employee
- Upload Document
- Add Inspection Record
- Create User

Avoid using FABs for secondary or destructive actions.

---

# Anatomy

A Floating Action Button consists of:

- Circular Container
- Icon
- Optional Label (Extended FAB)
- Elevation
- Focus Indicator

Example

# Variants

## Standard FAB

Contains a single icon representing the primary action.

Recommended for:

- Create
- Add
- Upload

---

## Extended FAB

Contains an icon and descriptive label.

Example

+ New Application

Recommended when additional context improves usability.

---

## Mini FAB

A smaller version of the standard FAB.

Use only where screen space is limited.

---

# Behavior

Floating Action Buttons should:

- Trigger one primary action.
- Remain visible while users navigate the page.
- Display immediate visual feedback.
- Support keyboard interaction.
- Animate smoothly when appearing or disappearing.

Only one primary FAB should appear on a screen.

---

# States

Every Floating Action Button supports:

## Default

Ready for interaction.

---

## Hover (Web)

Displayed when the cursor is over the FAB.

Provides subtle elevation or color feedback.

---

## Pressed

Displayed while the FAB is being activated.

---

## Focus

Displayed during keyboard navigation.

Must remain clearly visible.

---

## Disabled

Displayed when the action is unavailable.

Disabled FABs should:

- Prevent interaction.
