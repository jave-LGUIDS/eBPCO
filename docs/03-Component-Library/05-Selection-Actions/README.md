# Purpose

Selection and Action components allow users to choose options, confirm preferences, trigger commands, and perform operations throughout the eBPCO system.

These components are fundamental to forms, workflows, data management, navigation, and administrative operations.

This specification applies to:

- Angular Web Administration Portal
- Flutter Mobile Application

---

# Objectives

Selection and Action components should:

- Make available actions easy to understand.
- Distinguish primary, secondary, and destructive actions.
- Support efficient and accurate user decisions.
- Maintain consistent behavior across platforms.
- Meet accessibility requirements.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.
- Reuse shared components instead of creating one-off implementations.

---

# Scope

1. Buttons
2. Button Groups
3. Checkboxes
4. Radio Buttons
5. Switches
6. Segmented Controls

# Selection Principles

Selection controls should help users understand:

- What options are available.
- Whether one or multiple options may be selected.
- Whether a choice takes effect immediately.
- Whether the choice can be reversed.
- Whether the selection is required.

Selection controls must not rely on visual appearance alone to communicate their state.

---

# Action Principles

Actions should be:

- Clearly labeled.
- Visually prioritized.
- Positioned consistently.
- Easy to activate.
- Reversible where practical.
- Confirmed when destructive or irreversible.

Every action should communicate its purpose before the user activates it.

---

# Action Hierarchy

The eBPCO interface uses the following action hierarchy:

## Primary Action

The most important action on the current screen or section.

Examples:

- Submit Application
- Save Changes
- Continue
- Approve Permit

Only one primary action should normally appear within a single action group.

---

## Secondary Action

An alternative or supporting action.

Examples:

- Save Draft
- Back
- Preview
- Download

Secondary actions should be visually less prominent than the primary action.

---

## Tertiary Action

A low-emphasis action that supports the current task.

Examples:

- Cancel
- Learn More
- Clear
- Reset

Tertiary actions may use text-only or subtle button styles.

---

## Destructive Action

An action that removes, cancels, rejects, or permanently changes data.

Examples:

- Delete
- Reject
- Cancel Application
- Remove User

Destructive actions must:

- Be visually distinguished.
- Use explicit labels.
- Require confirmation when irreversible.
- Never be positioned as the default action.

---

# Selection Models

## Single Selection

Use when users may choose only one option.

Recommended components:

- Radio Buttons
- Segmented Controls
- Dropdowns

Example:

Payment Method

- Bank Transfer
- Onsite Payment

---

## Multiple Selection

Use when users may choose more than one option.

Recommended component:

- Checkboxes

Example:

Required Business Activities

- Retail
- Food Service
- Manufacturing

---

## Binary Selection

Use when a setting has two opposing states.

Recommended component:

- Switch

Example:

Notifications

On / Off

---

# Immediate and Deferred Actions

## Immediate Action

The change takes effect as soon as the user interacts with the component.

Recommended for:

- Switches
- Display preferences
- Simple filters

The interface should provide immediate feedback.

---

## Deferred Action

The change is applied only after the user confirms or submits.

Recommended for:

- Forms
- Permit applications
- Account updates
- Administrative changes

Deferred actions should include a clear Save, Apply, Continue, or Submit control.

---

# Labels

Labels should:

- Use clear action-oriented language.
- Describe the result of the action.
- Avoid vague wording.
- Remain concise.
- Use consistent terminology throughout the application.

Preferred labels:

- Save Changes
- Submit Application
- Download Receipt
- Approve Permit
- Reject Application

Avoid:

- OK
- Yes
- Do It
- Proceed
- Click Here

Context-specific labels are more informative than generic labels.

---

# Button Placement

## Desktop

Recommended order:

```text
[Secondary Action] [Primary Action]
```

Example:

```text
[Cancel] [Save Changes]
```

For destructive confirmation dialogs:

```text
[Keep Record] [Delete Record]
```

---

## Mobile

Primary actions may be:

- Full width
- Fixed near the bottom
- Positioned after the content
- Displayed in a Floating Action Button where appropriate

Actions must not conflict with:

- Bottom Navigation
- Safe areas
- System gestures
- On-screen keyboards

---

# Loading Behavior

When an action is being processed:

- Disable repeated activation.
- Display a loading indicator.
- Preserve the action label where space allows.
- Prevent duplicate submissions.
- Provide success or error feedback.

Example:

```text
[Submitting…]
```

Do not leave users uncertain about whether an action was triggered.

---

# Disabled States

Disabled controls should:

- Remain readable.
- Clearly appear unavailable.
- Preserve their label.
- Avoid relying on reduced opacity alone.
- Provide guidance when the reason is not obvious.

When practical, explain why the action is unavailable.

Example:

```text
Submit Application
Complete all required fields before submission.
```

---

# Touch Targets

Interactive controls should provide sufficiently large activation areas.

Recommended minimum:

- Angular Web: 40 × 40 px
- Flutter Mobile: 48 × 48 logical pixels

Visual elements may appear smaller, but their interactive area should meet the minimum target size.

---

# Keyboard Interaction

Interactive components should support:

- Tab navigation
- Enter activation
- Space activation where appropriate
- Arrow-key selection for grouped controls
- Visible focus states
- Escape dismissal for temporary action surfaces

Keyboard behavior must follow the expected semantic behavior of each component.

---

# Accessibility

Selection and Action components shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Support screen readers.
- Include visible focus indicators.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast.
- Use semantic controls.
- Communicate selected, disabled, loading, and error states.
- Avoid using color as the only state indicator.

Labels must be programmatically associated with their controls.

---

# Responsive Behavior

## Desktop

- Actions may appear inline.
- Button groups may use horizontal layouts.
- Contextual actions may appear in menus.
- Hover and focus states should be supported.

## Tablet

- Maintain adequate spacing.
- Reduce action density when necessary.
- Use overflow menus for secondary actions.

## Mobile

- Prefer clear vertical action layouts.
- Use full-width primary actions where appropriate.
- Avoid placing many actions in one row.
- Use bottom sheets for larger action collections.
- Respect safe areas and Bottom Navigation.

---

# Design Tokens

Selection and Action components consume:

- Color Tokens
- Typography Tokens
- Spacing Tokens
- Radius Tokens
- Elevation Tokens
- Motion Tokens
- State Tokens
- Size Tokens

Hardcoded visual values are prohibited unless formally approved and documented.

---

# Angular Implementation

Angular implementations should:

- Use reusable shared components.
- Integrate with Angular Forms where applicable.
- Consume centralized SCSS Design Tokens.
- Support loading, disabled, focus, and validation states.
- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Avoid duplicated button and selection-control styling.

Recommended location:

```text
src/app/shared/components/selection-actions/
```

Suggested structure:

```text
selection-actions/
├── button/
├── button-group/
├── checkbox/
├── radio-button/
├── switch/
├── segmented-control/
├── contextual-action/
└── index.ts
```

---

# Flutter Implementation

Flutter implementations should:

- Reuse shared widgets.
- Consume ThemeData.
- Respect AppColors.
- Respect AppTypography.
- Support Material state behavior.
- Preserve accessibility semantics.
- Respect safe areas and touch targets.

Recommended location:

```text
lib/shared/widgets/selection_actions/
```

Suggested structure:

```text
selection_actions/
├── app_button.dart
├── app_button_group.dart
├── app_checkbox.dart
├── app_radio.dart
├── app_switch.dart
├── segmented_control.dart
├── contextual_action.dart
└── selection_actions.dart
```

# Shared Naming

Component names should remain aligned across both platforms.

| Purpose | Angular | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Primary button | `EbpcPrimaryButtonComponent` | `EbpcPrimaryButton` |
| Secondary button | `EbpcSecondaryButtonComponent` | `EbpcSecondaryButton` |
| Checkbox | `EbpcCheckboxComponent` | `EbpcCheckbox` |
| Radio button | `EbpcRadioComponent` | `EbpcRadio` |
| Switch | `EbpcSwitchComponent` | `EbpcSwitch` |
| Segmented control | `EbpcSegmentedControlComponent` | `EbpcSegmentedControl` |

Equivalent naming helps developers understand the shared architecture across repositories.
