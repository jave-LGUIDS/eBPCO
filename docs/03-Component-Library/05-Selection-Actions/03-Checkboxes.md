# Checkboxes

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Approved
Document Owner: UI/UX Team

Category: Selection & Actions

---

# Purpose

Checkboxes allow users to select zero, one, or multiple independent options from a list.

Unlike Radio Buttons, Checkboxes do not restrict users to a single selection. Each Checkbox functions independently, making them suitable for scenarios where multiple selections are valid.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Checkboxes should:

- Support multiple independent selections.
- Clearly communicate selected and unselected states.
- Provide immediate visual feedback.
- Support accessibility requirements.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.
- Be implemented as reusable shared components.

---

# Usage

Use Checkboxes when users may select multiple options simultaneously.

Recommended examples:

- Business Activities
- Required Documents
- User Permissions
- Notification Preferences
- Terms and Conditions
- Bulk Record Selection
- Inspection Requirements

Checkboxes should never be used when only one option may be selected.

---

# Anatomy

A Checkbox consists of:

- Checkbox Container
- Selection Indicator
- Label
- Optional Supporting Text
- Optional Validation Message
- Focus Indicator

Example

+-------------------------------------------+
| ☑ Barangay Clearance                      |
+-------------------------------------------+

---

# Variants

## Standard Checkbox

Supports individual multiple selections.

Recommended for:

- Business Activities
- Document Requirements
- Notification Preferences

---

## Checkbox Group

A collection of related Checkboxes sharing a common heading.

Recommended for:

- Permissions
- Required Documents
- Business Categories

---

## Parent Checkbox

Controls all child Checkboxes.

Example

☐ Select All

☑ Barangay Clearance

☑ Fire Safety Certificate

☐ Occupancy Permit

Selecting the parent Checkbox selects or deselects all child Checkboxes.

---

## Indeterminate Checkbox

Represents a partially selected Checkbox Group.

Example

◩ Select All

The indeterminate state should only be controlled programmatically.

---

# Behavior

Checkboxes should:

- Toggle independently.
- Preserve user selections during navigation.
- Display immediate visual feedback.
- Support keyboard interaction.
- Retain state until changed or reset.

Checkboxes should never automatically deselect other Checkboxes.

---

# States

Every Checkbox supports:

## Unchecked

The option is not selected.

---

## Checked

The option has been selected.

---

## Indeterminate

Represents a partially selected Checkbox Group.

Only applicable to Parent Checkboxes.

---

## Hover (Web)

Displayed when the cursor is over the Checkbox.

Provides subtle visual feedback.

---

## Focus

Displayed during keyboard navigation.

Must remain clearly visible.

---

## Disabled

Unavailable for interaction.

Disabled Checkboxes should:

- Preserve readable labels.
- Clearly indicate they are unavailable.
- Avoid relying solely on reduced opacity.

---

## Error

Displayed when validation fails.

Example

Select at least one required document.

---

# Labels

Checkbox labels should:

- Clearly describe the option.
- Use concise language.
- Remain understandable without additional context.

Preferred

- Barangay Clearance

---

# Checkbox Groups

Example

Business Activities

☐ Manufacturing

---

# Validation

Validation may require:

- At least one selection.
- A minimum number of selections.
- Acceptance of Terms and Conditions.

Validation messages should appear immediately below the Checkbox Group.

---

# Accessibility

Checkboxes shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Support screen readers.
- Include visible focus indicators.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast.
- Associate labels programmatically.

Keyboard interaction

# Responsive Behavior

Desktop

- Labels displayed beside Checkboxes.
- Vertical grouping preferred.
- Hover states supported.

Tablet

- Increase spacing where necessary.
- Preserve logical grouping.

Mobile

- Larger touch targets.
- Increased spacing between options.

# Design Tokens

Checkboxes consume:

- Color Tokens
- Typography Tokens
