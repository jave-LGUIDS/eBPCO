# Purpose

The Navigation category defines reusable components that enable users to move efficiently throughout the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) ecosystem.

Navigation should help users understand:

- Where they are
- Where they can go
- How to return
- How information is organized

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Navigation components should:

- Provide intuitive movement throughout the application.
- Maintain consistent information architecture.
- Support responsive layouts.
- Minimize cognitive load.
- Support accessibility.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Scope

This category includes:

- App Bar
- Sidebar
- Bottom Navigation
- Breadcrumbs
- Tabs
- Stepper
- Pagination
- Drawers
- Menus

Each specification defines:

- Purpose
- Usage
- Anatomy
- Variants
- Behavior
- Accessibility
- Responsive behavior
- Design Tokens
- Angular implementation
- Flutter implementation
- AI Development Guidelines
- Governance

# Navigation Principles

Navigation should always:

- Be predictable.
- Be consistent.
- Minimize unnecessary steps.
- Clearly indicate the current location.
- Preserve user orientation.
- Adapt appropriately to screen size.

---

# Platform Guidelines

## Angular Web Administration Portal

Primary navigation should use:

- Sidebar
- App Bar
- Breadcrumbs

Secondary navigation may use:

- Tabs
- Menus
- Pagination

---

## Flutter Mobile Application

Primary navigation should use:

- Bottom Navigation
- App Bar
- Drawers (when necessary)

Secondary navigation may use:

- Tabs
- Stepper
- Menus

Breadcrumbs are generally unnecessary on mobile due to limited screen space.

---

# Responsive Strategy

Desktop

- Sidebar navigation
- App Bar
- Breadcrumbs

Tablet

- Collapsible Sidebar
- App Bar

Mobile

- Bottom Navigation
- App Bar
- Drawer (optional)

Navigation should adapt without changing terminology or hierarchy.

---

# Accessibility

Navigation components shall comply with WCAG 2.1 AA.

Components should:

- Support keyboard navigation.
- Provide visible focus indicators.
- Maintain sufficient contrast.
- Support screen readers.
- Clearly identify the current page.

---

# Design Tokens

Navigation components consume:

- Color Tokens
- Typography Tokens
- Spacing Tokens
- Motion Tokens
- Radius Tokens
- Elevation Tokens

Hardcoded styling is prohibited.

---

# Angular Implementation

Navigation components should:

- Be reusable.
- Consume centralized SCSS tokens.
- Support routing integration.
- Separate presentation from navigation logic.

Recommended structure:

shared/components/navigation/

---

# Flutter Implementation

Navigation components should:

- Reuse shared widgets.
- Consume ThemeData.
- Respect AppColors.
- Respect AppTypography.
- Integrate with centralized routing.

Recommended structure:

shared/widgets/navigation/

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated navigation components must:

- Reuse documented components.
- Consume Design Tokens.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Maintain consistent hierarchy.
- Avoid undocumented navigation patterns.

---

# Governance

All Navigation components within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with this documentation.

New navigation components or variants require UI/UX approval before implementation.
