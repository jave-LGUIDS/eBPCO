# Purpose

Menus provide contextual access to actions, commands, and secondary navigation without permanently occupying screen space.

Menus help keep interfaces clean by presenting only the actions that are relevant to the current context.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Menus should:

- Organize contextual actions.
- Reduce visual clutter.
- Present actions only when needed.
- Support accessibility.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Usage

Use Menus for:

- Overflow actions
- Contextual item actions
- User account actions
- Table row actions
- Filtering and sorting options
- Quick settings

Recommended eBPCO examples:

- View Details
- Edit
- Download
- Print
- Archive
- Delete
- Export
- Logout

Menus should not replace primary navigation.

---

# Anatomy

A Menu consists of:

- Trigger
- Menu Container
- Menu Items

## Nested Menu

---

# Behavior

Menus should:

- Open adjacent to the trigger.
- Close after an action is selected.
- Close when users click or tap outside.
- Reposition automatically if near screen edges.
- Animate subtly.

Menus should never obscure the trigger completely.

---

# Menu Items

- Include icons only when they improve recognition.
- Group related actions together.

---

# Dividers

Use dividers to separate groups of actions.

Example

View

Edit

------------

Download

Export

------------

Delete

Avoid excessive separators.

---

# Destructive Actions

Destructive actions should:

- Be visually distinguished.
- Appear last.
- Require confirmation when appropriate.

Examples

Remove User

Confirmation Dialogs should be displayed before irreversible actions.

---

# Accessibility

Menus shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Provide visible focus indicators.

---

# Design Tokens

Menus consume:

- Color Tokens

- Elevation Tokens
- Radius Tokens

Hardcoded styling is prohibited.

---

# Angular Implementation

Angular Menus should:

- Be reusable shared components.
- Integrate with Angular Material Menu or an approved equivalent.
- Consume centralized SCSS tokens.
- Support icons, dividers, and nested menus.

Recommended location:

shared/components/navigation/menu/

---

# Flutter Implementation

Flutter Menus should:

- Reuse shared PopupMenuButton or approved custom menu widgets.
- Consume ThemeData.
- Respect AppColors.
- Respect AppTypography.
- Use bottom sheets for large action lists.

Recommended location:

shared/widgets/navigation/menu/

---

# Related Components

- App Bar – hosts overflow and account menus.
- Drawer – secondary navigation.

- Dialogs – confirm destructive actions.
- Tables – row-level action menus.
