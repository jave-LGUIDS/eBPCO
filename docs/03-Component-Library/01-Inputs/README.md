# Overview

The Inputs category defines all reusable components used to collect information from users throughout the eBPCO ecosystem.

These components are shared between the Angular Web Administration Portal and the Flutter Mobile Application to provide a consistent, accessible, and predictable user experience.

Input components must follow the Brand Guidelines, Design System, Accessibility Integration, and UX Standards.

---

# Objectives

The Inputs library exists to:

- Standardize data entry components.
- Improve consistency.
- Reduce implementation differences.
- Support accessibility.
- Simplify frontend development.
- Improve AI-assisted development.

---

# Scope

This category includes:

- Buttons
- Text Fields
- Text Areas
- Dropdowns
- Date Pickers
- Time Pickers
- Checkboxes
- Radio Buttons
- Switches
- Search Fields

These are the only approved input components unless new ones are formally documented.

---

# Shared Design Principles

All input components shall:

- Be visually consistent.
- Use approved Design Tokens.
- Support responsive layouts.
- Follow accessibility requirements.
- Provide clear interaction feedback.
- Display validation consistently.

---

# Common States

Every input component should support applicable states.

Standard states include:

- Default
- Hover (Web)
- Focus
- Active
- Pressed
- Selected
- Disabled
- Read Only
- Error
- Success
- Warning
- Loading (where applicable)

State behavior shall remain consistent across all components.

---

# Validation

Input validation should:

- Occur at appropriate times.
- Display messages near the affected field.
- Use plain language.
- Identify required corrections.
- Avoid technical terminology.

Validation should assist users rather than interrupt workflows.

---

# Labels

Every input shall provide a visible label.

Labels should:

- Clearly describe expected input.
- Remain visible during interaction.
- Be concise.
- Avoid abbreviations where possible.

Placeholder text must not replace labels.

---

# Helper Text

Helper text may be used to:

- Explain formatting.
- Clarify requirements.
- Provide examples.
- Describe optional behavior.

Helper text should appear before validation messages when both are present.

---

# Required Fields

Required fields shall:

- Display a consistent required indicator.
- Be identified before form submission.
- Avoid relying solely on color.

Optional fields should be clearly indicated where appropriate.

---

# Error Messages

Error messages should:

- Explain the issue.
- Suggest how to correct it.
- Be associated with the correct input.
- Remain visible until resolved.

Example:

Incorrect:

"Invalid Input"

Preferred:

"Business Name is required."

---

# Responsive Behavior

Input components shall adapt to:

- Desktop
- Laptop
- Tablet
- Mobile

Spacing, sizing, and alignment should follow the Design System.

---

# Accessibility

All input components shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Maintain visible focus.
- Provide semantic labels.
- Support screen readers.
- Maintain adequate touch target sizes.

Accessibility is mandatory.

---

# Angular Implementation

Angular input components should:

- Use Reactive Forms.
- Reuse shared form controls.
- Consume centralized SCSS tokens.
- Avoid inline styles.
- Display validation consistently.

---

# Flutter Implementation

Flutter input components should:

- Use centralized ThemeData.
- Reuse shared widgets.
- Respect Material accessibility.
- Maintain responsive layouts.
- Avoid duplicated widgets.

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated code shall:

- Reuse existing input components.
- Follow documented behaviors.
- Respect Design Tokens.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Avoid creating undocumented variants.

---

# Governance

Any new input component must:

- Solve a documented need.
- Receive UI/UX approval.
- Be documented before implementation.
- Include Angular and Flutter guidance.
