# Purpose

Dropdowns allow users to select one or more predefined options from a controlled list.

They reduce input errors, standardize data collection, and improve form consistency throughout the eBPCO ecosystem.

Dropdowns shall provide a predictable, accessible, and responsive user experience across both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Dropdowns should:

- Standardize user selections.
- Prevent invalid input.
- Simplify complex forms.
- Improve data consistency.
- Support accessibility.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Usage

Use Dropdowns when users must select from predefined values.

Common eBPCO examples include:

- Business Type
- Business Nature
- Barangay
- Municipality
- Province
- Application Status
- Payment Method
- Permit Type
- Occupancy Type
- Civil Status

Avoid Dropdowns when users need to enter free-form text.

# Variants

```

Preferred:

```
Please select a Payment Method.
```
