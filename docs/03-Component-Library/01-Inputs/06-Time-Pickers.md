# Purpose

Time Pickers allow users to select valid times using a structured interface instead of manually entering time values.

They reduce formatting errors, improve scheduling accuracy, and provide a consistent user experience throughout the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Time Pickers should:

- Standardize time selection.
- Minimize user errors.
- Improve scheduling workflows.
- Support accessibility.
- Prevent invalid time selections.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Usage

Use Time Pickers whenever users must select a time.

Common eBPCO examples include:

- Inspection Time
- Appointment Time
- Office Hours
- Payment Schedule
- Business Operating Hours
- Meeting Time

Avoid using standard Text Fields for time entry unless explicitly required.

---

# Anatomy

A standard Time Picker consists of:

- Label
- Input Container
- Selected Time
- Clock Icon
- Time Selection Dialog
- Hour Selector
- Minute Selector
- AM/PM Selector (when applicable)
- Helper Text (optional)
- Validation Message
- Required Indicator (when applicable)

# Time Format

The application shall use a consistent display format.

Preferred format:

24-hour

Examples:

If business requirements demand a 12-hour format, it should be applied consistently.

The chosen format should remain consistent across the application.

---
