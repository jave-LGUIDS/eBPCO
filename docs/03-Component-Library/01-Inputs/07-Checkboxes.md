# Purpose

Checkboxes allow users to independently select one or more options from a list.

Unlike Radio Buttons, Checkboxes do not enforce mutual exclusivity. Each option is treated independently, allowing users to select any combination that applies.

Checkboxes shall provide a consistent, accessible, and responsive experience throughout the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Checkboxes should:

- Support multiple independent selections.
- Clearly communicate selection state.
- Improve form usability.
- Support accessibility.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Usage

Use Checkboxes when users may select:

- Zero options
- One option
- Multiple options

Common eBPCO examples include:

- Required Document Checklist
- Business Activities
- Notification Preferences
- Terms and Conditions
- Consent Confirmation
- Report Filters
- User Permissions

Do not use Checkboxes when only one option may be selected.

---

# Anatomy

A standard Checkbox consists of:

- Checkbox Indicator
- Label
- Helper Text (optional)
- Validation Message (when applicable)
- Required Indicator (when applicable)

---
