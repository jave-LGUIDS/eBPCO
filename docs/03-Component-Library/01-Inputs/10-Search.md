# Purpose

The Search component enables users to quickly locate records, applications, businesses, payments, users, and other information within the eBPCO ecosystem.

Search should prioritize speed, accuracy, and consistency while minimizing user effort.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Search should:

- Help users find information efficiently.
- Reduce navigation time.
- Support large datasets.
- Improve productivity.
- Support accessibility.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Usage

Search is appropriate whenever users need to locate existing information.

Common eBPCO examples include:

- Business Registry
- Business Owners
- Permit Applications
- Payment Records
- Inspection Records
- User Accounts
- Notifications
- Audit Logs
- Reports

Search should not replace structured filters when users need precise control over results.

---

# Anatomy

A standard Search component consists of:

- Search Label (optional)
- Search Input
- Search Icon
- Clear Button
- Loading Indicator (when applicable)
- Search Suggestions (optional)
- Filter Button (optional)
- Validation Message (rarely required)

---

# Variants

---

---

# Search Behavior

Search should:

---

# Debouncing

Instant Search should debounce user input.

Recommended delay:

```

```

This reduces unnecessary processing while maintaining responsiveness.

---

# Minimum Search Length

Search should not execute until a minimum number of characters is entered when appropriate.

Recommended:

```
Minimum: 2–3 characters
```

Exceptions may apply for permit numbers or reference IDs.

---

# Search Results

Search results should:

- Display relevant information.
- Be ranked logically.
- Highlight matching text where appropriate.
- Preserve the user's search query.

---

# Search Suggestions

Suggestions should:

- Match partial input.
- Update dynamically.
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Disappear when focus is lost.

Suggestions should never obscure essential page content.

---

# Filters

Search Filters should:

- Be optional.
- Remain clearly labeled.
- Support multiple filter criteria.
- Display active filter indicators.
- Allow quick reset.

Example:

```
Status: Approved

Barangay: San Isidro

Business Type: Retail
```

---

# Empty State

Display guidance.

Example:

```

```

---

# No Results State

```

Avoid empty pages.

---

# Loading State

- Prevent duplicate requests.

Loading feedback should appear within the search area.

---

# Keyboard Support

Keyboard navigation should remain predictable.

---

# Accessibility

# Design Tokens

---
