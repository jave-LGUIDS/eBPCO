# Purpose

Error States communicate that requested content or functionality is temporarily unavailable due to an error while guiding users toward appropriate recovery actions.

Rather than displaying broken layouts, blank pages, or technical error messages, Error States explain the issue in a clear, user-friendly manner and provide actionable recovery options.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Error States should:

- Clearly communicate failures.
- Reduce user frustration.
- Offer recovery actions.
- Prevent confusion.
- Maintain accessibility.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Usage

Use Error States when:

- Data cannot be retrieved.
- Network requests fail.
- Server responses fail.
- Required resources are unavailable.
- Pages cannot be displayed.
- Feature initialization fails.
- User sessions expire unexpectedly.

Examples in eBPCO:

- Unable to load businesses.
- Failed to retrieve permit applications.
- Payment history unavailable.
- Notifications failed to load.
- Dashboard statistics unavailable.

Error States should replace the affected content area rather than leaving incomplete layouts.

---

# Anatomy

An Error State consists of:

- Error Illustration or Icon
- Title
- Description
- Primary Recovery Action
- Optional Secondary Action

Example

+----------------------------------------------+
|                ⚠                             |
|                                              |
|      Unable to Load Applications             |
|                                              |
| We couldn't retrieve your permit             |
| applications at this time.                   |
|                                              |
| [Try Again]   [Go to Dashboard]              |
