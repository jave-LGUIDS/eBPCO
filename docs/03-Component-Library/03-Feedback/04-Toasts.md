# Purpose

Toasts are lightweight, temporary notifications that inform users of completed actions or system events without interrupting their workflow.

Unlike Dialogs, Alerts, or Snackbars, Toasts require no user interaction and automatically disappear after a short period.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Toasts should:

- Provide immediate feedback.
- Confirm lightweight actions.
- Avoid interrupting workflows.
- Maintain accessibility.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Usage

Use Toasts for:

- Successful login
- Logout confirmation
- Data synchronized
- Settings updated
- Connection restored
- Session refreshed

Examples in eBPCO:

- Login successful.
- Profile updated.
- Notification settings saved.
- Changes synchronized.
- Password changed successfully.

Do not use Toasts for confirmations, critical warnings, or blocking errors.

---

# Anatomy

A Toast consists of:

- Optional Icon
- Message
