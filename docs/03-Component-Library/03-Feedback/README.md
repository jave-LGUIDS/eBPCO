# Purpose

The Feedback category defines reusable components that communicate system responses, application states, user confirmations, and operational progress throughout the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) ecosystem.

Effective feedback helps users understand what is happening, what actions are required, and whether operations have completed successfully.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Feedback components should:

- Communicate system status clearly.
- Reduce user uncertainty.
- Guide users toward successful task completion.
- Support accessibility.
- Maintain visual consistency.
- Consume approved Design Tokens.

---

# Scope

This category includes:

- Alerts
- Dialogs
- Snackbars
- Toasts
- Progress Indicators
- Empty States
- Error States
- Loading States

Each component specification defines:

- Purpose
- Usage
- Anatomy
- Variants
- States
- Behavior
- Accessibility
- Responsive behavior
- Design Tokens
- Angular implementation
- Flutter implementation
- AI development guidelines
- Governance

---

# Design Principles

Feedback components shall:

- Be timely.
- Be understandable.
- Be actionable.
- Minimize disruption.
- Match the severity of the message.
- Avoid overwhelming users.

---

# Feedback Hierarchy

Different feedback components serve different purposes.

| Component | Purpose | User Interaction |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Alert | Persistent important information | Optional |
| Dialog | Confirmation or decision | Required |
| Snackbar | Brief confirmation with optional action | Optional |
| Toast | Brief informational message | None |
| Progress Indicator | Show ongoing operations | None |
| Empty State | Explain missing content | Optional |
| Error State | Explain failures and recovery | Optional |
| Loading State | Indicate pending content | None |

The least disruptive component that satisfies the use case should be used.

---

# Accessibility

All Feedback components shall comply with WCAG 2.1 AA.

Components should:

- Support screen readers.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast.
- Provide semantic announcements.
- Avoid relying solely on color.
- Preserve keyboard accessibility where interactive.

---

# Design Tokens

Feedback components consume:

- Color Tokens
- Typography Tokens
- Spacing Tokens
- Radius Tokens
- Shadow Tokens
- Motion Tokens

Hardcoded styling is prohibited.

---

# Angular Implementation

Angular Feedback components should:

- Be reusable.
- Consume centralized SCSS tokens.
- Separate presentation from business logic.
- Support configurable variants.

Recommended structure:

shared/components/

---

# Flutter Implementation

Flutter Feedback components should:

- Reuse shared widgets.
- Consume ThemeData.
- Respect AppColors.
- Respect AppTypography.
- Separate presentation from business logic.

Recommended structure:

shared/widgets/

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated Feedback components must:

- Reuse documented components.
- Consume Design Tokens.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Match the appropriate severity.
- Avoid undocumented variants.

---

# Governance

All Feedback components within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with this documentation.

New Feedback components or variants require UI/UX approval before implementation.
