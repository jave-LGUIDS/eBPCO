# Purpose

The Design Principles define the philosophy behind every user interface decision within the eBPCO ecosystem.

These principles guide designers, developers, product owners, QA engineers, and AI-assisted development to ensure every feature contributes to a unified and professional user experience.

Whenever uncertainty exists, these principles take precedence over personal preference.

---

# Core Design Philosophy

Every interface should embody the following qualities:

- Professional
- Simple
- Consistent
- Accessible
- Efficient
- Transparent
- Citizen-Centered
- Scalable

---

# Principle 01 — Consistency Over Creativity

Consistency creates trust.

Reusable patterns should always be preferred over creating new visual styles.

Users should never need to relearn common interactions.

---

# Principle 02 — Simplicity First

Every screen should communicate its purpose immediately.

Remove unnecessary:

- Colors
- Buttons
- Decorations
- Text
- Animations

If something does not improve usability, it should not exist.

---

# Principle 03 — Clarity Before Speed

Users should understand an interface before interacting with it.

Always prioritize:

- Clear labels
- Predictable navigation
- Obvious actions
- Readable layouts

---

# Principle 04 — Function Drives Design

Design should support the workflow.

Visual appearance must never interfere with completing government services.

---

# Principle 05 — Accessibility by Default

Accessibility is part of the design process.

It is not an enhancement added later.

Every new component must satisfy accessibility requirements before approval.

---

# Principle 06 — Mobile and Web Share One Language

The Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application must feel like parts of the same ecosystem.

Shared elements include:

- Colors
- Typography
- Statuses
- Components
- Terminology
- Workflows

Platform differences should only improve usability.

---

# Principle 07 — Reuse Before Creating

Before designing a new component:

1. Check the Component Library.
2. Check the Design System.
3. Check the Stitch documentation.

If a suitable component exists, reuse it.

Only introduce new components after formal approval.

---

# Principle 08 — Predictable Navigation

Users should always know:

- Where they are
- How they arrived
- Where they can go next
- How to return

No screen should become a dead end.

---

# Principle 09 — Meaningful Feedback

Every important user action should receive feedback.

Examples:

- Success
- Warning
- Error
- Processing
- Completion

Users should never wonder whether an action succeeded.

---

# Principle 10 — Design for Scalability

Every component should be reusable across:

- Current modules
- Future eBPCO modules
- Additional workflows
- Future enhancements

Avoid one-off solutions.

---

# Principle 11 — AI-Ready Design

All design decisions should be understandable by humans and AI.

Every component should include:

- Purpose
- Rules
- States
- Tokens
- Accessibility
- Responsive behaviour
- Implementation guidance

This enables consistent AI-assisted frontend development.

---

# Principle 12 — Performance Matters

Interfaces should remain lightweight.

Avoid:

- Excessive animations
- Heavy graphics
- Unnecessary interactions

Performance contributes directly to user satisfaction.

---

# Decision Hierarchy

When conflicts arise:

1. Brand Guidelines
2. Design Principles
3. Design System
4. Component Library
5. Stitch Documentation
6. Product Requirements

Personal preference is never a design standard.

---

# Developer Guidelines

Developers should:

- Reuse approved components.
- Follow documented tokens.
- Respect accessibility.
- Preserve navigation consistency.
- Avoid introducing undocumented patterns.

---

# AI Generation Guidelines

AI-generated interfaces must:

- Follow every approved design principle.
- Use documented components only.
- Respect the Design System.
- Preserve navigation flow.
- Follow responsive standards.

---

# Governance

Every new design proposal shall be evaluated against these principles before implementation.

If a proposal violates these principles, it must be revised before approval.
