# Purpose

Accessibility ensures that the eBPCO ecosystem is usable by all users, including those with visual, motor, cognitive, and hearing impairments.

Accessibility requirements apply equally to:

- Angular Web Administration Portal
- Flutter Mobile Application

Every screen, reusable component, and future enhancement must comply with this document.

---

# Accessibility Principles

The eBPCO ecosystem follows four fundamental principles:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

These principles align with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

---

# Compliance Target

Minimum Compliance

WCAG 2.1 Level AA

Future Goal

WCAG 2.2 Level AA

---

# Color & Contrast

Text must always meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

Never rely solely on color to communicate:

- Status
- Errors
- Warnings
- Success
- Notifications

Always pair colors with:

- Labels
- Icons
- Badges
- Supporting text

---

# Typography

Minimum body text:

14px

Avoid:

- Decorative fonts
- Excessively thin fonts
- Low contrast text

Maintain sufficient spacing between lines and paragraphs.

---

# Keyboard Navigation (Web)

Every interactive element must support keyboard navigation.

Users must be able to:

- Navigate using Tab
- Navigate backwards using Shift + Tab
- Activate using Enter
- Activate buttons using Space
- Close dialogs using Escape

Keyboard traps are prohibited.

---

# Focus Indicators

Interactive elements must display a visible focus state.

Focus indicators must never be removed.

Focus styling must remain consistent across the application.

---

# Forms

Every input requires:

- Visible label
- Accessible name
- Error message
- Validation feedback
- Required field indicator

Error messages must explain:

- What is wrong
- How to fix it

---

# Buttons

Buttons must:

- Have descriptive text
- Maintain minimum touch targets
- Support keyboard activation
- Display disabled states clearly

Avoid vague labels such as:

- Click Here
- Submit

Prefer:

- Submit Application
- Save Changes
- Approve Permit

---

# Icons

Icons must never be the only method of communication.

Interactive icons require:

- Tooltip (Web)
- Semantic label
- Screen reader description

---

# Images & Illustrations

Decorative images:

Hidden from screen readers.

Informative images:

Require descriptive alternative text.

---

# Tables

Tables must include:

- Header associations
- Logical reading order
- Accessible sorting
- Accessible pagination

---

# Dialogs

Dialogs must:

- Trap keyboard focus while open
- Restore focus when closed
- Provide keyboard dismissal where appropriate

---

# Notifications

Notifications should:

- Remain readable
- Avoid disappearing too quickly
- Not interrupt keyboard navigation

Critical notifications require explicit dismissal.

---

# Motion & Animation

Animations must:

- Be subtle
- Never trigger seizures
- Avoid excessive flashing

Users should be able to reduce motion in future versions.

---

# Responsive Accessibility

Touch targets:

Minimum

44 × 44 px

Spacing between interactive elements should prevent accidental activation.

---

# Error Prevention

Critical actions such as:

- Delete
- Reject
- Archive
- Release

must require confirmation before execution.

---

# Screen Reader Support

All interactive elements must expose:

- Accessible names
- Roles
- States
- Values

Reading order must follow the visual hierarchy.

---

# Angular Implementation Notes

- Use semantic HTML whenever possible.
- Apply ARIA attributes only when necessary.
- Test with keyboard-only navigation.
- Validate accessibility during component reviews.

---

# Flutter Implementation Notes

- Use Flutter Semantics widgets where appropriate.
- Ensure widgets expose meaningful labels.
- Maintain accessible focus order.
- Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS).

---

# AI Generation Notes

When generating UI:

- Follow WCAG AA.
- Include accessible labels.
- Preserve keyboard navigation.
- Never remove focus indicators.
- Avoid inaccessible custom widgets.

---

# Accessibility Review Checklist

Every UI must satisfy:

- Keyboard accessible
- Screen reader compatible
- WCAG AA contrast
- Responsive touch targets
- Accessible forms
- Accessible tables
- Accessible dialogs
- Accessible navigation
- Accessible notifications

Only after passing this checklist may a feature be considered complete.

---

# Governance

Accessibility compliance is mandatory.

Any component failing accessibility review must be corrected before release.

Accessibility exceptions require formal approval.
