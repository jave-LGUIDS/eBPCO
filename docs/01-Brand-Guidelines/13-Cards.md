# Purpose

Cards are reusable containers that organize related information into clear, visually distinct sections.

They provide structure throughout the eBPCO ecosystem, including dashboards, forms, reports, workflow summaries, notifications, and mobile interfaces.

Every card must follow this specification.

# Design Principles

Cards must be:

- Simple
- Consistent
- Informative
- Responsive
- Accessible
- Reusable

Cards organize information—they should never become decorative.
