# Purpose

The Light Theme defines the official visual appearance of the eBPCO ecosystem.

Version 1.0 supports Light Theme exclusively for both the Angular Web Administration Portal and the Flutter Mobile Application.

All UI components shall reference semantic design tokens instead of hardcoded color values.

---

# Theme Philosophy

The Light Theme is designed to be:

- Professional
- Clean
- Government-appropriate
- Accessible
- Calm
- Readable
- Consistent

The interface should minimize visual fatigue while maintaining strong content hierarchy.

# Future Dark Theme Readiness

All components must reference semantic tokens so Dark Theme can be introduced without rewriting components.

Text → Theme.TextPrimary
```

Never bind components directly to HEX values.
