# Purpose

This document defines how the eBPCO Design System shall be implemented within the Angular Web Administration Portal.

It establishes architectural standards, folder organization, theming, component development practices, styling conventions, and coding guidelines to ensure a consistent and maintainable frontend application.

This document is mandatory for all Angular frontend development.

---

# Objectives

The Angular implementation exists to:

- Ensure consistency across the application.
- Reduce duplicated code.
- Improve maintainability.
- Support reusable components.
- Simplify onboarding for developers.
- Improve AI-assisted frontend development.

---

# Technology Stack

The Angular Web Administration Portal shall use:

- Angular (Latest LTS)
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Angular Router
- Angular CDK
- RxJS

Additional libraries shall be evaluated before adoption to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

---

# Project Structure

Recommended structure:

```
src/
│
├── app/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── shared/
│   ├── features/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── guards/
│   ├── interceptors/
│   ├── models/
│   └── routes/
│
├── assets/
│
├── styles/
│   ├── _colors.scss
│   ├── _typography.scss
│   ├── _spacing.scss
│   ├── _radius.scss
│   ├── _shadows.scss
│   ├── _motion.scss
│   ├── _variables.scss
│   └── theme.scss
│
└── environments/
```

---

# Theme Integration

All styling shall originate from the centralized theme.

Components must consume:

- Color Tokens
- Typography Tokens
- Spacing Tokens
- Radius Tokens
- Shadow Tokens
- Motion Tokens

Hardcoded visual values are prohibited.

---

# Styling Standards

Preferred styling approach:

- SCSS Modules
- Shared variables
- CSS Custom Properties
- Utility mixins where appropriate

Avoid inline styles.

---

# Component Architecture

Reusable components belong inside:

```
shared/components/
```

Examples:

```
Button

Card

Dialog

Input

Badge

Chip

Table

Loader

Snackbar

Avatar

Status Chip
```

Feature-specific components belong within their respective feature modules.

---

# Layout Architecture

Layouts should be separated from business features.

Recommended layouts include:

- Authentication Layout
- Dashboard Layout
- Full Width Layout
- Settings Layout

Screens should reuse layout components whenever possible.

---

# Routing Standards

Routes should:

- Use lazy loading.
- Apply route guards.
- Use descriptive route names.
- Support breadcrumbs.
- Follow a hierarchical structure.

Example:

```
/dashboard

/businesses

/businesses/:id

/applications

/settings
```

---

# State Management

State should be managed using:

- Angular Signals (where appropriate)
- RxJS Observables
- Shared services

Avoid unnecessary global state.

---

# Services

Business logic belongs inside services.

Services should:

- Perform API communication.
- Handle data transformation.
- Remain reusable.
- Avoid UI logic.

Components should focus on presentation.

---

# Forms

Forms should:

- Use Reactive Forms.
- Display inline validation.
- Support accessibility.
- Reuse shared form components.

Avoid template-driven forms for complex workflows.

---

# Tables

Data tables should support:

- Sorting
- Filtering
- Pagination
- Empty states
- Loading states
- Error states

Reusable table components are preferred.

---

# Component Communication

Preferred communication order:

1. @Input()

2. @Output()

3. Shared Service

4. State Management

Avoid deeply nested event chains.

---

# Naming Conventions

Components

```
BusinessCardComponent
```

Services

```
BusinessService
```

Interfaces

```
Business
```

Enums

```
ApplicationStatus
```

Files

```
business-card.component.ts
```

Maintain consistent naming throughout the application.

---

# Accessibility

Angular implementation must:

- Use semantic HTML.
- Preserve keyboard navigation.
- Maintain visible focus.
- Support screen readers.
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.

---

# Performance

Developers should:

- Lazy load feature modules.
- Optimize change detection.
- Reuse components.
- Minimize unnecessary rendering.
- Optimize assets.

---

# Testing

Frontend implementation should include:

- Unit Tests
- Component Tests
- Integration Tests
- Accessibility Tests

Testing should be included in the Definition of Done.

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated Angular code must:

- Follow the approved folder structure.
- Consume the centralized theme.
- Reuse shared components.
- Follow naming conventions.
- Avoid duplicate implementations.
- Respect accessibility requirements.

---

# Code Review Checklist

Every pull request should verify:

- Uses Design Tokens.
- Uses shared components.
- Follows routing standards.
- Meets accessibility requirements.
- Avoids hardcoded values.
- Includes responsive behavior.
- Passes linting and tests.

---

# Governance

All Angular development within the eBPCO project must comply with this implementation guide.

Exceptions require approval from the Frontend Lead and UI/UX Team.
