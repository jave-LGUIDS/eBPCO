# Purpose

Layout Patterns define standardized page structures used throughout the eBPCO ecosystem.

Instead of designing each screen independently, developers shall compose screens using approved layout patterns. This promotes consistency, improves maintainability, and accelerates frontend development across both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

The Layout Pattern system exists to:

- Standardize page composition.
- Improve navigation consistency.
- Increase UI predictability.
- Reduce duplicated layouts.
- Simplify AI-assisted development.
- Improve scalability.

---

# Source of Truth

The official Layout Patterns shall be derived from the approved Angular Web Administration Portal.

Flutter shall implement equivalent layouts while adapting them for mobile-first interaction.

---

# Design Principles

Every page should:

- Follow a consistent hierarchy.
- Maintain predictable spacing.
- Reuse existing components.
- Prioritize readability.
- Minimize cognitive load.
- Support responsive behavior.
