# 16 Flutter Implementation

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Approved
Document Owner: Frontend Team

Category: Platform Implementation

---

# Purpose

This document defines how the eBPCO Design System shall be implemented within the Flutter Mobile Application.

It establishes architectural standards, folder organization, theming, reusable widgets, state management, navigation, responsive layouts, and coding conventions to ensure a consistent, maintainable, and scalable mobile application.

This document is mandatory for all Flutter frontend development.

---

# Objectives

The Flutter implementation exists to:

- Ensure UI consistency.
- Improve maintainability.
- Promote reusable widgets.
- Support scalable application growth.
- Simplify onboarding.
- Improve AI-assisted frontend development.

---

# Technology Stack

The Flutter Mobile Application shall use:

- Flutter (Latest Stable)
- Dart
- Material Design 3
- ThemeData
- GoRouter (or approved navigation package)
- Provider, Riverpod, or approved state management solution

Additional packages shall require technical review before adoption.

# Theme Integration

Every widget shall consume the centralized Theme Architecture.

Widgets must reference:

- AppColors
- AppTypography
- AppSpacing
- AppRadius
- AppShadows
- AppMotion

Hardcoded visual values are prohibited.

---

# Widget Architecture

Reusable widgets belong inside:

```
shared/widgets/
```

Examples:

- PrimaryButton
- SecondaryButton
- AppTextField
- StatusChip
- AppCard
- LoadingIndicator
- EmptyState
- ErrorState
- SearchBar
- AppDialog
- AppSnackbar
- Avatar

Feature-specific widgets belong inside their respective feature folders.

---

# Layout Architecture

Application layouts should be reusable.

Recommended layouts:

- Authentication Layout
- Dashboard Layout
- Application Layout
- Profile Layout
- Settings Layout

Each screen should reuse layouts instead of creating unique structures.

---

# Navigation

Navigation should be centralized.

Recommended routes:

```
/

/login

/dashboard

/applications

/payments

/notifications

/profile

/settings
```

Navigation logic should remain separate from UI widgets.

---

# State Management

Business state should be managed using the approved state management solution.

Responsibilities include:

- Loading data
- Form state
- Authentication state
- Navigation state
- UI state

Avoid storing business logic inside widgets.

---

# Widget Responsibilities

Widgets should:

- Display information.
- Receive data.
- Trigger callbacks.
- Remain reusable.
- Avoid business logic.

Business logic belongs in controllers, providers, or services.

---

# Forms

Forms should:

- Reuse AppTextField.
- Display inline validation.
- Support accessibility.
- Preserve user input.
- Prevent duplicate submissions.

Complex forms should be divided into logical sections.

---

# Lists and Tables

Mobile interfaces should prefer:

- Cards
- ListView
- Paginated lists
- Expandable items

Desktop Flutter implementations may use DataTable where appropriate.

---

# Responsive Layouts

Flutter layouts should adapt using:

- LayoutBuilder
- MediaQuery
- Expanded
- Flexible
- Wrap
- GridView
- Slivers

Avoid fixed dimensions whenever possible.

---

# Accessibility

Flutter implementation must:

- Use Semantics widgets.
- Support screen readers.
- Preserve keyboard navigation.
- Respect text scaling.
- Maintain accessible touch targets.
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA principles where applicable.

---

# Performance

Developers should:

- Minimize unnecessary rebuilds.
- Use const constructors where appropriate.
- Optimize image loading.
- Lazy load large datasets.
- Reuse widgets.
- Keep widget trees manageable.

---

# Assets

Assets should be organized into:

```
assets/

images/

icons/

illustrations/

animations/

logos/
```

Avoid duplicating assets.

---

# Naming Conventions

Widgets

```
BusinessCard
```

Screens

```
BusinessDetailsScreen
```

Controllers

```
BusinessController
```

Services

```
BusinessService
```

Files

```
business_card.dart

business_details_screen.dart
```

Maintain consistent naming throughout the application.

---

# Testing

Flutter development should include:

- Widget Tests
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- Accessibility Validation

Testing forms part of the Definition of Done.

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated Flutter code must:

- Follow the approved folder structure.
- Consume the centralized theme.
- Reuse shared widgets.
- Follow naming conventions.
- Avoid duplicated implementations.
- Respect accessibility requirements.
- Preserve responsive behavior.

---

# Code Review Checklist

Every pull request should verify:

- Uses Design Tokens.
- Uses shared widgets.
- Uses centralized themes.
- Avoids hardcoded values.
- Meets accessibility requirements.
- Supports responsive layouts.
- Passes static analysis and tests.

---
