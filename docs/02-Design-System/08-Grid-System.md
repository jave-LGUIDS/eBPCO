# Purpose

The Grid System establishes the structural layout framework used throughout the eBPCO ecosystem.

It provides consistent alignment, spacing, sizing, and positioning for all screens in the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

A standardized grid improves readability, scalability, maintainability, and responsive behavior.

---

# Objectives

The Grid System exists to:

- Create consistent page layouts.
- Standardize component alignment.
- Simplify responsive design.
- Improve readability.
- Reduce layout inconsistencies.
- Support reusable layout patterns.
- Improve AI-assisted frontend development.

---

# Source of Truth

The official Grid System shall be derived from the approved Angular Web Administration Portal.

Flutter shall adapt the same layout principles while respecting mobile-native interaction patterns.

---

# Design Principles

Every layout should follow these principles:

- Consistent alignment
- Predictable spacing
- Clear content hierarchy
- Responsive behavior
- Flexible layouts
- Reusable patterns

Layouts should prioritize usability over visual complexity.

---

# Grid Structure

The eBPCO Design System consists of:

- Page Container
- Columns
- Gutters
- Margins
- Rows
- Sections
- Content Areas

Each screen should align components within this structure.

---

# Page Container

Every screen shall be wrapped in a standardized page container.

The page container defines:

- Maximum content width
- Horizontal padding
- Vertical spacing
- Content alignment

No screen should position content directly against the browser or device edge unless explicitly required.

---

# Columns

Desktop layouts should use a multi-column grid.

Typical layout:

- Sidebar
- Main Content
- Optional Secondary Panel

Columns should resize responsively while maintaining alignment.

---

# Gutters

Gutters define spacing between columns.

All gutters must use approved Spacing Tokens.

Components must never create arbitrary spacing between columns.

---

# Rows

Rows organize content vertically.

Examples:

- Dashboard sections
- Forms
- Tables
- Lists
- Cards

Rows should maintain consistent vertical spacing.

---

# Sections

Large pages should be divided into logical sections.

Examples:

- Header
- Statistics
- Filters
- Content
- Actions
- Footer

Sections improve readability and navigation.

---

# Dashboard Layout

Dashboard screens should follow a consistent structure.

Typical order:

- Page Header
- Summary Cards
- Charts
- Recent Activity
- Quick Actions
- Tables

Widgets should align consistently across rows.

---

# Form Layout

Forms should follow a structured layout.

Recommended order:

- Title
- Description
- Input Groups
- Validation Messages
- Action Buttons

Multi-column forms should collapse gracefully on smaller screens.

---

# Table Layout

Tables should include:

- Toolbar
- Filters
- Search
- Table
- Pagination

Spacing between these elements should use approved Spacing Tokens.

---

# Card Layout

Cards should contain:

- Header
- Content
- Footer (optional)

Card spacing should remain consistent throughout the application.

---

# Navigation Layout

Navigation should define consistent placement for:

- Sidebar
- Top App Bar
- Breadcrumbs
- Page Title
- User Menu

Navigation placement should remain predictable across all screens.

---

# Responsive Layout

The Grid System must adapt for:

## Desktop

- Multi-column layouts
- Sidebar navigation
- Expanded tables
- Dashboard widgets

---

## Tablet

- Reduced spacing
- Flexible columns
- Condensed navigation

---

## Mobile

- Single-column layout
- Stacked components
- Bottom navigation (where applicable)
- Simplified interactions

Flutter should prioritize mobile-first layouts.

---

# Alignment Rules

Components should align consistently.

Preferred alignment:

- Left-aligned text
- Consistent content edges
- Uniform spacing
- Balanced white space

Avoid uneven layouts.

---

# Platform Implementation

## Angular

The Grid System should be implemented using:

- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Shared layout utilities

Developers should avoid inline layout styles.

---

## Flutter

The Grid System should be implemented using:

- Row
- Column
- Expanded
- Flexible
- Wrap
- LayoutBuilder
- GridView

Widgets should consume centralized layout utilities.

---

# Hardcoded Layouts

Hardcoded widths, margins, and positioning are prohibited except for documented exceptions approved by the UI/UX Team.

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated code must:

- Follow the approved Grid System.
- Use layout utilities.
- Respect responsive behavior.
- Reuse existing layout patterns.
- Avoid arbitrary positioning.

---

# Governance

Every screen within the eBPCO ecosystem must follow the approved Grid System.

Layout changes shall be reviewed by the UI/UX Team before implementation.
