# Purpose

User Flows define the optimal sequence of interactions users follow to complete tasks within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) ecosystem.

Well-designed user flows reduce cognitive load, minimize errors, improve efficiency, and ensure a consistent experience across the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

This specification establishes the standards for designing, documenting, and implementing user journeys.

---

# Objectives

User Flows should:

- Guide users toward successful task completion.
- Reduce unnecessary steps.
- Eliminate confusion.
- Improve consistency.
- Support accessibility.
- Reduce user errors.
- Improve completion rates.

---

# User Flow Principles

## Goal-Oriented

Every user flow must exist to accomplish a clearly defined goal.

Examples

- Apply for Business Permit
- Renew Business Permit
- Upload Documents
- Track Application
- Pay Permit Fees

Every screen should contribute directly toward completing that goal.

---

## Simplicity

User flows should contain only the necessary steps.

Avoid:

- unnecessary confirmations
- duplicate forms
- repeated information
- redundant navigation

Each step should have a clear purpose.

---

## Linear Progression

Where possible, user flows should progress in a logical sequence.

Example

Start

↓

Business Information

↓

Owner Information

↓

Upload Documents

↓

Review

↓

Submit

Users should clearly understand what comes next.

---

## Predictability

Actions should behave consistently throughout every workflow.

Examples

- Continue always advances.
- Back returns to the previous step.
- Cancel exits safely.
- Save Draft preserves progress.

Interaction patterns should never change unexpectedly.

---

## Error Recovery

Users should always have a way to recover from mistakes.

Examples

- Edit previous information.
- Retry failed uploads.
- Correct validation errors.
- Save incomplete work.

Users should never lose completed work unnecessarily.

---

# Flow Structure

Every user flow should contain:

- Entry Point
- Task Steps
- Validation
- Confirmation
- Completion
- Exit

Each stage should have a clearly defined purpose.

---

# Progress Indicators

Multi-step workflows should display progress indicators.

Recommended examples:

- Stepper
- Progress Bar
- Step Counter

Example

Step 2 of 5

Business Information

Progress indicators should accurately reflect completion status.

---

# Navigation Rules

Users should always know:

- their current step
- completed steps
- remaining steps
- available actions

Navigation should never create uncertainty.

---

# Save Progress

Long workflows should support saving progress.

Recommended examples:

- Business Permit Applications
- Renewal Applications
- Inspection Forms

Users should be able to resume unfinished tasks later.

---

# Confirmation Screens

Critical workflows should conclude with a confirmation screen.

Confirmation should include:

- Success message
- Reference number
- Next steps
- Available follow-up actions

Example

Application Submitted Successfully

Reference Number

BP-2026-001245

---

# Exit Strategy

Users should be able to safely exit workflows.

Recommended options

- Save Draft
- Cancel
- Return to Dashboard

Users should receive confirmation before abandoning unsaved changes.

---

# Error Handling

When errors occur, workflows should:

- explain the issue
- identify affected fields
- provide recovery instructions
- preserve entered information

Example

"The uploaded document exceeds the maximum file size."

---

# Decision Points

Decision points should:

- clearly present available choices
- explain consequences
- minimize ambiguity

Example

Payment Method

- Bank Transfer
- Onsite Payment

Users should understand each option before proceeding.

---

# Accessibility

User Flows shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Provide logical focus order.
- Announce progress updates to assistive technologies.
- Preserve accessibility throughout every workflow.

Accessibility should never be interrupted during task completion.

---

# Responsive Behavior

Desktop

- Display progress indicators.
- Support multi-column layouts where appropriate.

Tablet

- Simplify layouts while preserving workflow order.

Mobile

- Single-column layouts.
- Larger touch targets.
- Vertical progression.
- Persistent progress indicators.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

User Flows support:

- Forms
- Navigation
- Validation
- Feedback Components
- Information Architecture
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated workflows must:

- Follow approved user flow patterns.
- Minimize unnecessary steps.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Maintain logical progression.
- Support error recovery.
- Preserve saved progress where applicable.
- Avoid undocumented workflow changes.

AI should optimize usability without altering approved business processes.

---

# Governance

All workflows within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with this specification.

Changes to approved user flows require review and approval from the UI/UX Team before implementation.
