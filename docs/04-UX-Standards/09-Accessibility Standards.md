# Purpose

Accessibility Standards establish the minimum usability requirements to ensure the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) ecosystem is usable by all individuals, including persons with disabilities (PWDs), older adults, and users with temporary or situational impairments.

Accessibility is a fundamental quality requirement and shall be integrated throughout the design and development lifecycle—not treated as an optional enhancement.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Accessibility should:

- Ensure equal access to government services.
- Meet international accessibility standards.
- Improve usability for all users.
- Support assistive technologies.
- Reduce barriers to completing digital services.
- Maintain consistency across platforms.

---

# Accessibility Principles

The eBPCO ecosystem follows the four principles of WCAG.

## Perceivable

Information must be presented in ways users can perceive.

Examples

- Text alternatives for icons.
- Captions for multimedia.
- Sufficient color contrast.
- Visible labels.

---

## Operable

All functionality must be operable using different input methods.

Examples

- Keyboard navigation.
- Touch accessibility.
- Screen reader compatibility.
- Logical focus order.

---

## Understandable

Interfaces should be predictable and easy to understand.

Examples

- Consistent navigation.
- Clear instructions.
- Helpful validation.
- Simple language.

---

## Robust

Interfaces should work reliably across browsers, devices, and assistive technologies.

Examples

- Semantic HTML.
- Proper ARIA usage.
- Standards-compliant code.
- Compatible screen reader support.

---

# Compliance Level

The eBPCO platform shall comply with:

- WCAG 2.1 Level AA

Future upgrades should target WCAG 2.2 where feasible.

---

# Color Contrast

Minimum contrast ratios:

Normal Text

4.5 : 1

Large Text

3 : 1

Interactive Elements

3 : 1 minimum against adjacent colors.

Color alone shall never communicate important information.

---

# Keyboard Accessibility

Every interactive component shall be fully usable with a keyboard.

Required support:

- Tab
- Shift + Tab
- Enter
- Space
- Escape
- Arrow Keys (where applicable)

No keyboard traps shall exist.

---

# Focus Management

Keyboard focus should:

- Always remain visible.
- Move logically.
- Follow reading order.
- Return appropriately after dialogs close.

Focus indicators should never be removed.

---

# Screen Reader Support

Interfaces shall provide:

- Meaningful labels.
- Semantic headings.
- Descriptive buttons.
- Accessible form controls.
- Live announcements for important updates.

Avoid generic labels such as:

Button

Input

---

# Forms

Accessible forms should include:

- Visible labels.
- Required field indicators.
- Helper text.
- Associated validation messages.
- Programmatically linked controls.

Users should never rely on placeholder text alone.

---

# Images and Icons

Images that convey meaning shall include alternative text.

Decorative images should be ignored by assistive technologies.

Icons should include accessible labels whenever they perform actions.

---

# Tables

Accessible tables shall include:

- Header rows.
- Proper table semantics.
- Clear relationships between headers and cells.
- Readable layouts on smaller screens.

Avoid using tables for page layout.

---

# Navigation

Navigation should:

- Follow a consistent order.
- Include descriptive labels.
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Maintain logical hierarchy.

Users should always know where they are.

---

# Error Messages

Errors should:

- Be announced by screen readers.
- Explain the problem.
- Explain how to recover.
- Preserve entered information.

Error messages should appear close to the affected control.

---

# Motion and Animation

Animations should:

- Support reduced-motion preferences.
- Avoid excessive movement.
- Never trigger seizures or vestibular discomfort.

Users should be able to disable non-essential animation.

---

# Time Limits

Where time limits exist:

- Notify users before expiration.
- Allow extension where appropriate.
- Preserve user progress whenever possible.

---

# Responsive Accessibility

Accessibility shall remain consistent across:

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile

Touch targets should be at least:

44 × 44 px

Recommended minimum spacing should prevent accidental taps.

---

# Assistive Technologies

The application should support:

- Screen Readers
- Keyboard Navigation
- Voice Control Software
- Screen Magnifiers
- High Contrast Modes
- Operating System Accessibility Features

---

# Accessibility Testing

Every release should include accessibility validation.

Recommended testing includes:

- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen reader testing
- Color contrast verification
- Focus order validation
- Responsive accessibility testing
- Automated accessibility scanning
- Manual usability evaluation

Accessibility testing should be integrated into every sprint.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Accessibility Standards support:

- UX Principles
- Navigation Experience
- Form Experience
- Error Handling & Recovery
- Feedback & System Status
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines
- Component Library

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated interfaces must:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements.
- Preserve semantic structure.
- Maintain keyboard accessibility.
- Generate descriptive labels.
- Preserve focus management.
- Avoid inaccessible interaction patterns.
- Never rely solely on color to communicate meaning.

Accessibility shall be treated as a mandatory requirement rather than an optional enhancement.

---

# Governance

All interfaces within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with this accessibility specification.

Accessibility compliance shall be verified before production deployment.

Any exceptions require documented approval from the UI/UX Team and Project Management.
