# Purpose

Error Handling & Recovery defines the standards for communicating errors, preventing user frustration, and helping users recover from problems throughout the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) ecosystem.

Errors should never leave users confused, uncertain, or unable to continue their tasks. Every error must provide sufficient context, guidance, and recovery options while maintaining a professional and trustworthy user experience.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Error handling should:

- Prevent user frustration.
- Clearly communicate problems.
- Help users recover quickly.
- Preserve user-entered information.
- Minimize task interruption.
- Support accessibility standards.
- Improve user confidence.

---

# Error Handling Principles

## Prevent Before Correct

Interfaces should prevent errors whenever possible rather than correcting them afterward.

Examples

- Input validation
- Date pickers
- Dropdown selections
- Input masks
- Required field indicators

Preventing mistakes is always preferable to displaying error messages.

---

## Clear Communication

Every error message should explain:

- What happened.
- Why it happened.
- How to fix it.
- What happens next.

Users should never have to guess what went wrong.

---

## Preserve User Progress

Errors should never erase completed work.

Examples

- Preserve form inputs.
- Preserve uploaded documents.
- Preserve selected options.
- Preserve navigation state.

Only the affected information should require correction.

---

## Actionable Guidance

Every error should include a clear recovery path.

Preferred

"The uploaded file exceeds the maximum size of 10 MB. Please upload a smaller file."

Avoid

"Upload Failed."

---

# Error Categories

## Validation Errors

Occur when user input does not meet requirements.

Examples

- Invalid email address
- Missing required fields
- Incorrect file format

Validation should occur as early as possible.

---

## System Errors

Occur due to unexpected application failures.

Examples

- Server unavailable
- Database timeout
- Internal processing error

Users should receive a clear explanation without exposing technical details.

---

## Network Errors

Occur when connectivity is interrupted.

Examples

- No internet connection
- Request timeout
- Connection lost

Users should be encouraged to retry once connectivity is restored.

---

## Permission Errors

Occur when users attempt unauthorized actions.

Example

"You do not have permission to access this page."

Provide guidance for contacting the appropriate administrator if necessary.

---

## Business Rule Errors

Occur when business policies prevent an action.

Example

"This permit has already been approved and can no longer be edited."

These messages should explain the applicable business rule.

---

# Error Message Standards

Error messages should:

- Use plain language.
- Avoid technical terminology.
- Remain concise.
- Explain the problem.
- Suggest the next action.

Preferred

"Please select a payment method before continuing."

Avoid

"Validation Exception 400."

---

# Validation Messages

Validation messages should appear:

- Immediately after validation.
- Beside or below the affected field.
- Before form submission when possible.

Validation should not interrupt typing unnecessarily.

---

# Confirmation Before Destructive Actions

Actions such as:

- Delete
- Archive
- Reject
- Remove

should require user confirmation.

Example

Delete Business Permit?

This action cannot be undone.

[Cancel]

[Delete]

---

# Recovery Options

Users should be provided with appropriate recovery actions.

Examples

- Retry
- Edit
- Go Back
- Save Draft
- Contact Support

Recovery options should be immediately visible whenever possible.

---

# Offline Recovery

When connectivity is unavailable:

- Notify users immediately.
- Preserve unsaved work.
- Automatically retry when appropriate.
- Allow manual retry.

Users should never lose data due to temporary network interruptions.

---

# Accessibility

Error handling shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Announce errors to assistive technologies.
- Maintain logical keyboard focus.
- Associate validation messages with affected fields.
- Avoid relying solely on color.

Users with assistive technologies should receive equivalent feedback.

---

# Responsive Behavior

Desktop

- Display inline validation.
- Preserve page layout.
- Highlight affected sections.

Tablet

- Maintain readable spacing.
- Display validation near controls.

Mobile

- Display full-width validation.
- Scroll automatically to the first error.
- Preserve entered information.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Error Handling & Recovery supports:

- Form Experience
- User Flows
- Feedback Components
- Accessibility Standards
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated interfaces must:

- Follow approved validation patterns.
- Preserve user input after errors.
- Use consistent error messaging.
- Avoid exposing technical implementation details.
- Provide actionable recovery guidance.
- Maintain accessibility compliance.

AI should prioritize user recovery over technical accuracy in messaging.

---

# Governance

All error handling within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with this specification.

Changes to validation behavior, recovery workflows, or error messaging standards require approval from the UI/UX Team before implementation.
