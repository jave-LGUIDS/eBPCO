# Purpose

Responsive UX defines how the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) ecosystem adapts user experiences across different devices, screen sizes, and input methods while maintaining consistency, usability, and accessibility.

Responsive design is more than resizing layouts—it ensures users can accomplish the same tasks efficiently whether using a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

This specification applies to both the Angular Web Administration Portal and Flutter Mobile Application.

---

# Objectives

Responsive UX should:

- Deliver a consistent experience across devices.
- Optimize layouts for each screen size.
- Preserve usability regardless of resolution.
- Reduce unnecessary scrolling.
- Support touch and mouse interactions.
- Maintain accessibility compliance.
- Ensure business workflows remain uninterrupted.

---

# Responsive Design Principles

## Mobile-First Thinking

Interfaces should prioritize the mobile experience while scaling gracefully to larger displays.

Design should begin with the essential content and progressively enhance for tablets and desktops.

---

## Content First

Content takes priority over decoration.

Users should immediately see:

- Primary actions
- Important information
- Current task
- Progress

Secondary information should appear afterward.

---

## Adaptive Layouts

Layouts should adapt rather than simply shrink.

Examples

Desktop

- Multi-column layouts
- Persistent navigation
- Expanded tables

Tablet

- Reduced columns
- Collapsible navigation

Mobile

- Single-column layouts
- Vertical scrolling
- Simplified navigation

---

## Consistency

Regardless of device:

- Navigation remains recognizable.
- Terminology remains identical.
- Workflows remain unchanged.
- Components behave consistently.

Users should never relearn the application because they changed devices.

---

# Breakpoints

Recommended responsive breakpoints

Mobile

- Up to 767 px

Tablet

- 768–1023 px

Desktop

- 1024 px and above

These values serve as design guidelines and may be refined during implementation.

---

# Layout Standards

## Desktop

Recommended characteristics:

- Sidebar navigation
- Multi-column forms
- Data-rich tables
- Dashboard widgets
- Breadcrumb navigation

Desktop layouts should maximize productivity.

---

## Tablet

Recommended characteristics:

- Collapsible sidebar
- Two-column layouts where appropriate
- Comfortable spacing
- Simplified dashboards

Tablet experiences should balance information density and touch interaction.

---

## Mobile

Recommended characteristics:

- Single-column layouts
- Drawer navigation
- Bottom navigation for primary destinations
- Full-width forms
- Simplified dashboards

Content should remain easy to scan using one hand.

---

# Navigation Behavior

Responsive navigation should adapt according to device.

Desktop

Persistent sidebar

Tablet

Collapsible sidebar

Mobile

Navigation Drawer

Bottom Navigation (for primary destinations)

Navigation hierarchy should remain consistent.

---

# Forms

Responsive forms should:

Desktop

- Multiple columns
- Inline helper text

Tablet

- Reduced columns
- Comfortable spacing

Mobile

- Single-column layout
- Large touch targets
- Full-width controls
- Sticky action buttons when appropriate

---

# Data Tables

Large tables should adapt responsively.

Desktop

- Full data table
- Multiple columns
- Advanced filtering

Tablet

- Horizontal scrolling if necessary
- Reduced visible columns

Mobile

- Card layouts where appropriate
- Expandable rows
- Prioritize important information

Users should never lose access to critical data because of screen size.

---

# Images and Media

Images should:

- Scale proportionally.
- Maintain clarity.
- Avoid distortion.
- Load efficiently.

Decorative media should never interfere with usability.

---

# Touch Interaction

Touch interfaces should provide:

- Minimum 44 × 44 px touch targets.
- Adequate spacing between controls.
- Gesture support where appropriate.
- Visible interaction feedback.

Accidental touches should be minimized.

---

# Performance

Responsive interfaces should:

- Minimize unnecessary downloads.
- Optimize image sizes.
- Lazy-load large content.
- Reduce rendering overhead.

Performance is part of the user experience.

---

# Accessibility

Responsive UX shall:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Preserve keyboard navigation.
- Maintain logical focus order.
- Support screen readers.
- Preserve readable typography.
- Avoid horizontal scrolling for standard content.

Accessibility should remain consistent across all devices.

---

# Cross-Platform Consistency

The Angular Web Portal and Flutter Mobile Application should share:

- Terminology
- Navigation hierarchy
- Color usage
- Typography
- Component behavior
- Status indicators
- Icons
- Validation patterns

Platform-specific adaptations are acceptable when they improve usability without altering workflows.

---

# Testing Requirements

Responsive UX should be validated on:

Desktop

- Large monitors
- Standard laptops

Tablet

- Portrait
- Landscape

Mobile

- Small phones
- Large phones

Testing should verify:

- Layout adaptation
- Navigation
- Forms
- Tables
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Touch interactions

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Responsive UX supports:

- Accessibility Standards
- Navigation Experience
- Form Experience
- Information Architecture
- Mobile Guidelines
- Web Guidelines
- Design System

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated interfaces must:

- Follow approved responsive layouts.
- Preserve navigation hierarchy.
- Maintain accessibility.
- Reuse approved Design System components.
- Avoid creating device-specific workflows.
- Ensure consistency between Angular and Flutter implementations.

AI should optimize layouts while preserving the same user experience across devices.

---

# Governance

All responsive implementations within the eBPCO ecosystem shall comply with this specification.

Changes to responsive layouts, breakpoint strategies, or adaptive interaction patterns require approval from the UI/UX Team before implementation.
