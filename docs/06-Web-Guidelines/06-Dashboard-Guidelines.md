# Purpose

The Dashboard Guidelines establish the standards for designing dashboards within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) web application.

Dashboards provide users with an overview of important information, system activity, and actionable insights. Whether used by citizens, business owners, inspectors, or administrators, dashboards should present relevant information clearly and enable users to quickly perform their most important tasks.

This specification applies to all dashboard interfaces throughout the eBPCO platform.

---

# Objectives

Dashboards should:

- Present critical information at a glance.
- Prioritize frequently used actions.
- Support quick decision-making.
- Reduce navigation time.
- Improve operational efficiency.
- Maintain accessibility and responsiveness.
- Scale for future modules.

---

# Dashboard Design Principles

## Information First

Dashboards shall prioritize meaningful information over decorative elements.

Users should immediately understand:

- Current status
- Pending tasks
- Recent activity
- Important notifications
- Available actions

Visual design should support—not distract from—these objectives.

---

## Role-Based Content

Dashboard content shall be personalized according to the authenticated user's role.

Examples

Citizen

- Application Status
- Pending Requirements
- Payment Status
- Notifications

Business Owner

- Business Summary
- Active Permits
- Renewal Schedule
- Payment History

Inspector

- Assigned Inspections
- Inspection Schedule
- Pending Reports

Administrator

- System Statistics
- User Activity
- Pending Applications
- Reports
- Audit Logs

Users should only see information relevant to their responsibilities.

---

## Action-Oriented Design

Dashboards should encourage users to complete important tasks.

Primary actions may include:

- Submit Application
- Renew Permit
- Upload Documents
- Review Applications
- Generate Reports

Actions should be immediately visible.

---

## Progressive Disclosure

Only the most important information should appear on the dashboard.

Detailed information should be accessible through:

- View More
- Details
- Reports
- Dedicated modules

Dashboards should summarize rather than replace full management pages.

---

# Standard Dashboard Structure

A dashboard should include:

1. Page Header
2. Welcome Section
3. Quick Actions
4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
5. Recent Activity
6. Notifications
7. Charts and Analytics
8. Upcoming Tasks
9. Footer

Not every dashboard requires every section, but the overall structure should remain familiar.

---

# Welcome Section

The welcome section should provide:

- User greeting
- Current role
- Organization or business name (when applicable)
- Current date
- Brief summary of outstanding work

Example

Welcome, Juan Dela Cruz.

You have 2 pending permit applications requiring your attention.

---

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs provide a high-level overview of important metrics.

Examples

Citizen

- Active Applications
- Pending Payments
- Approved Permits

Business Owner

- Registered Businesses
- Expiring Permits
- Outstanding Requirements

Administrator

- Total Applications
- Approved Today
- Pending Reviews
- Active Users

KPIs should use concise labels and clearly display values.

---

# Quick Actions

Frequently used actions should be easily accessible.

Examples

- New Business Registration
- Apply for Permit
- Renew Permit
- Upload Requirements
- Print Permit
- Export Report

Quick actions should be displayed prominently near the top of the dashboard.

---

# Recent Activity

Recent activity should display the latest user or system actions.

Examples

- Permit Submitted
- Payment Verified
- Application Approved
- Document Uploaded

Each activity item should include:

- Description
- Date and time
- Related transaction
- Link to details

---

# Notifications

Dashboard notifications should summarize important updates.

Examples

- Application Approved
- Additional Documents Required
- Payment Confirmed
- Scheduled Maintenance

Users should be able to navigate directly to the relevant screen.

---

# Charts and Analytics

Dashboards may include charts where they provide meaningful insight.

Examples

- Applications by Status
- Monthly Permit Issuance
- Revenue Overview
- Inspection Completion Rate
- Daily Transactions

Charts should:

- Use approved colors.
- Include legends.
- Provide descriptive titles.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Charts should complement—not replace—data tables.

---

# Upcoming Tasks

Users should be informed of upcoming deadlines.

Examples

- Permit Renewal Due
- Inspection Schedule
- Pending Approval
- Document Submission Deadline

Tasks should include:

- Description
- Due date
- Priority
- Action button

---

# Dashboard Cards

Dashboard information should be organized using standardized cards.

Cards should maintain consistent:

- Border radius
- Padding
- Typography
- Elevation
- Spacing

Each card should focus on a single purpose.

---

# Empty States

If no dashboard information is available, display an informative empty state.

Example

No Pending Applications

You currently have no active business permit applications.

Where appropriate, include a primary action.

Example

Apply for a Business Permit

---

# Loading States

Dashboard loading should use:

- Skeleton cards
- Placeholder charts
- Loading indicators

Avoid displaying empty dashboards while data is loading.

---

# Error States

If dashboard data cannot be loaded, the interface should provide:

- Clear explanation
- Retry option
- Support information if necessary

Example

Unable to load dashboard information.

Please try again.

---

# Accessibility

Dashboards shall comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

Requirements include:

- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Accessible charts
- Sufficient color contrast
- Visible focus indicators
- Descriptive headings

Alternative text or summaries should accompany visualizations where appropriate.

---

# Responsive Behavior

Desktop

- Multi-column dashboard
- Expanded analytics
- Side-by-side cards

Tablet

- Two-column layout
- Stacked charts
- Reduced spacing

Mobile Web

- Single-column layout
- Full-width cards
- Simplified charts

Users should retain access to all critical information regardless of screen size.

---

# Performance

Dashboards should:

- Load essential information first.
- Defer non-critical analytics.
- Cache frequently viewed metrics.
- Minimize unnecessary API requests.
- Refresh data efficiently.

Performance should prioritize rapid access to operational information.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Dashboard Guidelines support:

- Web Design Principles
- Layouts and Grid
- Data Tables
- Responsive Web
- Performance Guidelines
- Design System
- UX Standards

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated dashboards must:

- Follow approved dashboard layouts.
- Prioritize role-based information.
- Use standardized KPI cards.
- Present concise analytics.
- Maintain accessibility.
- Optimize performance.
- Generate responsive layouts.

AI should produce dashboards that enable users to understand system status and complete tasks quickly while maintaining the professional standards expected of government enterprise software.

---
