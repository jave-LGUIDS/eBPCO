# Purpose

The Responsive Web specification defines how the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) web application adapts to different screen sizes, resolutions, devices, and orientations.

Responsive design ensures that users experience a consistent, efficient, and accessible interface whether accessing the system from desktop computers, laptops, tablets, or mobile browsers.

This specification applies to all web-based interfaces within the eBPCO ecosystem.

---

# Objectives

Responsive design should:

- Provide a consistent user experience across devices.
- Maintain usability regardless of screen size.
- Prevent layout distortion.
- Preserve accessibility.
- Optimize content presentation.
- Improve performance.
- Support future device categories.

---

# Responsive Design Principles

## Mobile-First Philosophy

Interfaces shall be designed using a mobile-first approach and progressively enhanced for larger screens.

Benefits include:

- Simpler layouts
- Better performance
- Improved accessibility
- Easier scalability

Core functionality should always remain available regardless of device.

---

## Fluid Layouts

Layouts shall adapt dynamically to available screen space.

Interfaces should:

- Expand naturally.
- Collapse appropriately.
- Avoid fixed-width containers.
- Prevent horizontal scrolling whenever possible.

Layouts should remain flexible without compromising readability.

---

## Content Priority

Essential content should always appear before secondary information.

Examples

Primary

- Page Title
- Main Actions
- Business Information
- Forms

Secondary

- Analytics
- Help Panels
- Additional Details

Critical tasks should remain immediately accessible.

---

## Consistency

Users should experience the same workflows regardless of device.

Examples

- Login process
- Permit application
- Payment workflow
- Dashboard navigation

Only the presentation should change—not the functionality.
