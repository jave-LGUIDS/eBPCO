# Purpose

The Browser Support specification defines the officially supported web browsers, compatibility requirements, and progressive enhancement strategies for the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO) platform.

Since the system serves citizens, business owners, inspectors, and government employees using various devices and browsers, the application must provide a reliable, secure, and consistent experience across supported environments.

This specification applies to all web applications, administrative portals, and public-facing websites within the eBPCO ecosystem.

---

# Objectives

Browser support should:

- Deliver a consistent user experience.
- Support modern web standards.
- Ensure accessibility across supported browsers.
- Minimize browser-specific issues.
- Improve long-term maintainability.
- Reduce compatibility-related defects.
- Encourage standards-compliant development.

---

# Browser Support Principles

## Standards-Based Development

Applications shall be built using modern web standards.

Developers should rely on:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- ECMAScript standards
- WAI-ARIA
- Responsive design principles

Avoid browser-specific implementations whenever possible.

---

## Progressive Enhancement

Core functionality shall remain available even when advanced browser features are unavailable.

Priority order:

1. Core functionality
2. Enhanced interactions
3. Advanced visual effects

Users should always be able to complete essential government transactions.

---

## Graceful Degradation

If certain visual enhancements are unsupported, the application should continue functioning without affecting usability.

Examples include:

- Animations
- Visual effects
- Decorative enhancements

Critical workflows shall never depend on unsupported browser features.

---

# Officially Supported Browsers

The eBPCO platform officially supports the latest stable versions of:

Desktop

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari

Mobile

- Chrome for Android
- Safari for iOS
- Samsung Internet
- Microsoft Edge Mobile

Support applies to the latest two major stable releases unless organizational requirements specify otherwise.

---

# Unsupported Browsers

The following are not officially supported:

- Internet Explorer
- Legacy Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML)
- Obsolete browser versions no longer receiving security updates
- Browsers with disabled JavaScript (where application functionality depends on it)

Users accessing unsupported browsers should receive an informative notification.

---

# Responsive Compatibility

Supported browsers shall provide consistent behavior across:

- Desktop
- Laptop
- Tablet
- Mobile Browser

Layouts should adapt appropriately without loss of functionality.

---

# JavaScript Compatibility

JavaScript features shall:

- Follow current ECMAScript standards.
- Avoid experimental APIs in production.
- Provide fallbacks where practical.
- Be compatible with supported browsers.

Application functionality should not rely on vendor-specific implementations.

---

# CSS Compatibility

CSS should:

- Use standardized properties.
- Avoid unsupported experimental features in production.
- Use responsive layouts.
- Provide graceful fallbacks where appropriate.

Visual consistency should be maintained across supported browsers.

---

# HTML Compatibility

Applications shall use semantic HTML elements.

Examples include:

- header
- nav
- main
- section
- article
- footer

Semantic HTML improves:

- Accessibility
- Browser compatibility
- Search engine indexing
- Maintainability

---

# Forms

Forms shall behave consistently across supported browsers.

Requirements include:

- Input validation
- File uploads
- Date selection
- Keyboard navigation
- Autofill compatibility

Browser differences should not affect transaction completion.

---

# File Downloads

Downloads should function consistently across supported browsers.

Supported file types may include:

- PDF
- CSV
- XLSX

Downloads should preserve filenames and content integrity.

---

# File Uploads

Uploads shall support:

- Drag and drop where available.
- Traditional file selection.
- Upload progress indicators.
- Validation feedback.

Fallback behavior should remain available if advanced upload features are unsupported.

---

# Browser Storage

Where browser storage is used, it should only store non-sensitive information.

Examples include:

- User preferences
- Theme selection
- Draft form data
- Session preferences

Sensitive government or personal information shall never be stored insecurely in browser storage.

---

# Cookies

Cookies shall:

- Support secure authentication.
- Use Secure and HttpOnly attributes where applicable.
- Respect applicable privacy regulations.
- Minimize unnecessary tracking.

Users should be informed of cookie usage where required.

---

# Accessibility

Browser compatibility shall preserve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

Supported browsers must maintain:

- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Color contrast
- Accessible forms

Accessibility shall not vary significantly between supported browsers.

---

# Performance

Performance expectations apply equally across supported browsers.

Applications should:

- Load efficiently.
- Render consistently.
- Minimize browser-specific performance issues.
- Optimize resource usage.

Performance should be monitored using representative browser environments.

---

# Browser Testing

Compatibility testing shall include:

Desktop Browsers

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari

Mobile Browsers

- Chrome
- Safari
- Samsung Internet
- Edge Mobile

Testing should verify:

- Authentication
- Navigation
- Forms
- Dashboards
- Data Tables
- File Uploads
- Downloads
- Responsive Layouts
- Accessibility

---

# Browser Updates

Supported browser versions should be reviewed periodically.

The Development Team shall:

- Monitor browser release cycles.
- Identify deprecated features.
- Update compatibility testing procedures.
- Revise implementation standards when necessary.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Browser Support complements:

- Responsive Web
- Web Accessibility
- Performance Guidelines
- Forms and Data Entry
- Navigation Patterns
- AI Development Standards

---

# AI Development Guidelines

AI-generated web applications must:

- Use standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Avoid browser-specific implementations.
- Generate responsive layouts.
- Preserve accessibility across supported browsers.
- Provide graceful degradation where necessary.
- Follow progressive enhancement principles.
- Maintain consistent behavior in all officially supported browsers.

AI should generate browser-compatible interfaces that remain reliable, secure, and maintainable throughout the lifecycle of the eBPCO platform.

---

# Governance

All web applications within the eBPCO platform shall comply with this Browser Support specification.

Any decision to support or discontinue browser compatibility shall require approval from the Development Team and Project Management.
